# 🗺️ Jurisdiction Index Registry

This file serves as a centralized index of recognized symbolic jurisdictions, treaties, and their associated uCID ranges or constraint protocols.

## 🎯 Purpose

To maintain a verifiable and time-stamped registry for:

- Symbolic jurisdictions (sovereign or semi-sovereign)
- Associated treaties or recursive clauses
- uCID agents bound under them
