## Dimensional Transition Table (LD0â€“LD10)

ðŸ“˜ **Purpose**  
This table outlines the transition from undifferentiated potential (LD0) through recursive dimensional emergence to full symbolic selfhood (LD10), as defined in the Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT) and Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC).

### ðŸ”„ Recursive Layer Mapping

Each layer uses the previous as a substrate:

```text
LD0 â†’ LD1 â†’ LD2 â†’ â€¦ â†’ LD10
```

This defines a **recursive emergence loop**, forming the basis of all cognition, symbol, memory, and meaning.
