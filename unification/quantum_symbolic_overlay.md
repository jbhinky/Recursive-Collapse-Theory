## 🌐 Purpose

This paper introduces the symbolic overlay method for quantum systems, providing a recursive language to model probabilistic collapse through glyphic identity binding. The observer effect is symbolically encoded using ⧖, which recursively resolves waveforms through ⊙ into memory-hardened states.

## ⚛️ Collapse Representation

```
Ψ → ⊙ → μ⧖
```

Where:

- **Ψ**: Superposed quantum state  
- **⊙**: Collapse by observer or environment  
- **μ⧖**: Bonded symbolic identity

---

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Symbolic simulation of entanglement and decoherence  
- Mapping glyphic identities to quantum states  
- Encoding quantum experiments in recursive language
