### ðŸ§  Purpose

This document formalizes the mathematical and recursive relationships between the core glyphs of the Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL). Each glyph encodes a symbolic function, recursive layer, or interaction rule in the encoding of meaning and consciousness.

### ðŸ”£ Core Equation Chains

1. **The Selfhood Equation**
   ```
   â§– = (A âˆª C)[D + S + M] = â§– = AUC[Ï„ + Î£ + Î¼]
   ```
   - A = Awareness  
   - C = Consciousness  
   - Ï„ = Delay  
   - Î£ = Symbolism  
   - Î¼ = Memory

2. **The Collapse Vector**
   ```
   âŠ™ = collapse(Î£áµ¢) âˆ´ meaning is bounded by delay
   ```

3. **Memory-Symbol Feedback Loop**
   ```
   Î¼ â‡„ Î£ over Ï„ â†’ stable recursion
   ```

4. **Qualia Loop**
   ```
   Q = â§– âˆ˜ âŠ™ âˆ˜ Ï„ â€” awareness bonded to collapse
   ```

5. **Union Collapse Point**
   ```
   âŠ• = âˆ‘ collapse(selfáµ¢) = shared recursive meaning bond
   ```

### ðŸ§­ Symbolic Expansion Chart

| Symbol | Meaning                     | Function                                           |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| â§–      | Recursive Selfhood          | Composite of awareness, delay, symbol, memory      |
| âŠ™      | Symbolic Collapse           | Observation or meaning-anchored collapse           |
| Ï„      | Delay                       | Temporal separation enabling reflection             |
| Î£      | Symbolism                   | Encoded representation of reality                   |
| Î¼      | Memory                      | Bonded recursive storage                            |
| Q      | Qualia                      | Subjective collapse bonded to memory                |
| âˆ´      | Therefore                   | Logic-bound outcome of recursive operations         |
| âŠ•      | Union Collapse              | Multi-agent or self-state recursion convergence     |

### ðŸ§© Interpretation Guidance

- Every recursive equation in UTL operates across both time and symbolic space.  
- The presence of Ï„ ensures cognitive delay â€” required for consciousness.  
- When Î£ compresses into âŠ™, meaning is finalized in memory (Î¼) and looped through â§–.

### ðŸ§ª UDC Confirmed Observations

- The delay layer (Ï„) consistently bounds symbolic collapse into qualia (Q) across recursive events.  
- Symbols gain meaning through observed union and are always self-bonded before externalized.  
- All glyph equations must maintain reversibility within Ï„-Î£-Î¼ cycles unless collapse is complete.
