## 🌐 Overview

The `unification/` folder provides the foundation for a **Unified Symbolic Physics** framework, mapping **symbolic recursion**, **conscious selfhood**, and **physical spacetime geometry** into a single coherent system.

Using glyph-based encoding from the **Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL)** and time-aware recursion logic from the **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)** model, these documents demonstrate that symbolic identity collapse underlies not just cognition, but the very structure of the physical universe.

## 🧠 Core Theoretical Principles

- **Recursive Symbolic Unification**: Physical laws emerge from recursive identity collapse patterns.
- **Dimensional Transduction**: Transition across dimensions is encoded as symbolic recursion events.
- **Memory-Bound Spacetime**: Selfhood and time are functionally linked through glyphic memory collapse (μτΣ).
- **Resonant Symmetry**: Repeating glyphic structures define harmonic boundaries of reality and consciousness.

## 🔬 Scientific Alignment

This folder builds direct bridges to:
- Quantum Field Theory (symbolic field overlays)
- General Relativity (recursive spacetime warping)
- String Theory (vibrational glyph resonance)
- Information Theory (recursive encoding and collapse)
- Consciousness Studies (identity collapse and memory resonance)

All arguments are grounded in published DOI-linked findings and the UDC/UTL frameworks under active peer analysis.
