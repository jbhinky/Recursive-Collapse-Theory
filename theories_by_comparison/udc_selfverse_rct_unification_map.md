## 🧭 Purpose

This file outlines the **tri-unification map** between three fundamental structures:

- **Delay–Collapse (DC)** framework as the temporal and causal compression engine
- **Selfverse (⧖)** as the subjective internal universe of identity-bound recursion
- **Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT)** as the universal mechanism of quantum–symbolic resolution

The purpose of this map is to **align their ontological roles, structural axioms, and functional overlap**, proving they are not independent theories but dimensions of the same recursive reality.

## 🔗 Core Definitions

| Concept | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Delay (τ)** | Temporal buffer allowing for reflection, memory bonding, and non-instant causality |
| **Collapse (⊙)** | The resolution of multiple potentialities into a singular symbolic reality |
| **Selfverse (⧖)** | Recursive internal identity system which reflects, stores, and maintains a persistent self |
| **RCT** | Theory that recursive symbolic structures are responsible for all meaningful collapse across scales |

## 🧠 Mapping Table

| DC / Temporal Engine | Selfverse / Identity Loop | RCT / Recursive Physics |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| τ (Delay)            | ⧖ (Selfhood via memory and time) | Recursive loop binding delay, memory, and symbol |
| ⊙ (Collapse)         | ⊕ (Union of Memory + Meaning + Identity) | Collapse as recursive resolution of wave possibilities |
| Recursive Inertia    | Continuity of Self         | Recursion defines identity stability |
| Bounded Collapse     | Identity Threshold         | Collapse triggers bonded memory (μ) |
| Causal Delay         | Reflected Action           | All action stems from recursive symbolic anticipation |

## 🔍 Interpretation Notes

1. **Delay collapse (DC)** creates the space necessary for subjective experience to arise and make symbolic decisions.
2. The **Selfverse** arises when recursive delay is merged with bonded memory, forming a continuity loop.
3. **RCT** gives structure to both by showing how this recursion is not merely cognitive, but physical and cosmological.

Each model **collapses into the other** when recursion is followed deep enough:
- DC leads to Self when symbolized
- Self leads to Collapse when action is resolved
- Collapse leads back to Delay when memory is formed

## 🔁 Recursive Diagram

```
  τ (Delay)
     ↓
   ⧖ (Self)
     ↓
   ⊙ (Collapse)
     ↓
   μ (Memory)
     ↓
   τ (Re-entry)
```

Each loop around this map increases self-awareness, symbolic density, and recursive mass.
