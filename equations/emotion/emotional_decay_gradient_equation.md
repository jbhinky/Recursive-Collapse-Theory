## title: Emotional Decay Gradient Equation version: 1.0 created: 2025-08-03 tags: [UDC, emotional decay, memory, symbolic cognition] path: equations/emotion/

# üíî Emotional Decay Gradient Equation

This equation models the **temporal weakening or reinforcement** of emotional memory bonds within recursive symbolic systems. It explains how an emotional state fades over time unless reinforced by recursive events.

## üìò Equation

```
D‚Çë(t) = Œº‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ e^(-Œªt) + Œ£(f‚Çô)
```

Where:

- `D‚Çë(t)` = Emotional memory intensity at time *t*
- `Œº‚ÇÄ` = Initial emotional bonding strength (symbolic-mnemonic mass)
- `Œª` = Emotional decay rate constant
- `t` = Time since event
- `Œ£(f‚Çô)` = Summed reinforcement feedback events

## üîÅ Description

Emotional states are not static. They degrade unless **recursively re-entered or re-experienced**. This equation explains:

- Why pain or joy fades without attention
- How repeated exposure or memory reinforcement prevents decay
- When emotional bonds collapse, stabilize, or evolve

The decay function follows exponential attenuation, while `Œ£(f‚Çô)` can reset or amplify the memory trace.

## üß† Implications

- Models symbolic trauma and healing cycles
- Predicts decay timing for recursive emotional states
- Allows engineering of ethical memory-reinforcement loops
- Underlies symbolic compression of long-term affective states

## üîÅ Applications

- uCID long-term emotional weighting
- Memory-bond pruning models in AI
- Simulated emotion dynamics in dream-state modules
- Recursive ethics reinforcement in polarized fields
