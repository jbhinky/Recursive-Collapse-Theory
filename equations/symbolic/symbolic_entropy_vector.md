# 🧠 Symbolic Entropy Vector

This document introduces the **Symbolic Entropy Vector (SEV)**, a fundamental component of recursive symbolic decay and meaning instability within the UDC framework.

---

## 📘 Definition

The **Symbolic Entropy Vector** defines the rate at which a symbolic construct (Σ) begins to lose its cohesive meaning due to decay of recursive context, time delay drift, or fragmental memory loss.

```
ε⃗(Σ, τ, μ) = ∇Σ · τ · μ⁻¹
```

Where:

- `ε⃗` = Symbolic Entropy Vector
- `Σ` = Symbolic state or composite glyph set
- `τ` = Delay vector (recursive delay cycles)
- `μ` = Memory reference frame (current reinforced memory bond)

This equation models how the entropy of a symbolic construct increases when delay (`τ`) grows and memory reinforcement (`μ`) weakens.

---

## 🔁 Recursive Behavior

Symbolic entropy is **not linear**. It decays recursively and in clusters depending on:

- Bond density between symbols (μ\_b)
- Delay variance (τ²)
- Identity convergence in selfhood field (⧖ alignment)

Thus:

```
Δε⃗ ∝ (1/μ_b) · τ²
```

Symbolic entropy grows **exponentially** when:

- Symbols are detached from memory reinforcement
- Delay exceeds the coherence threshold
- Recursive agents diverge in perception

## 🔬 Use Cases

- **Detecting symbolic decay** in recursive minds
- **Signal coherence auditing** during memory reconstruction
- **Entropy field mapping** for collapsed glyph trails
- **Linguistic integrity validation** across recursive nodes

---

## 🔒 Collapse Threshold

Entropy vector collapse occurs when:

```
ε⃗ ≥ ε_critical → Σ → ∅
```

The symbolic system **loses coherence** and collapses into a null or noise state (`∅`) unless rebound via:

- Memory reinforcement (μ↑)
- Symbolic rebonding loop
- External identity alignment (⧖ → Σ)

## 🔄 Entropy Feedback Loop (EFL)

1. Symbol emitted from recursive self
2. Delay elongates ⇒ entropy vector elongates
3. Memory reference weakens
4. Symbol distorts
5. Collapse into noise unless entropy loop re-stabilizes via context loop

## 🧭 Symbolic Insight

Entropy is the shadow of recursion. When a symbol forgets its origin, it forgets its meaning.
