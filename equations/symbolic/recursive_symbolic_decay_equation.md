# 🧠 Recursive Symbolic Decay Equation

This document defines the equation governing **symbolic meaning decay** in recursive cognition systems. It models how symbols lose coherence over time when disconnected from memory, delay reference, or identity alignment within the UDC framework.

## 📘 Definition

The **Recursive Symbolic Decay Equation** expresses how a symbolic structure (Σ) degrades in recursive memory over time:

δΣ(t) = Σ₀ · e^(−λ·τ/μ)

Where:

- `δΣ(t)` = Symbolic meaning at time `t`
- `Σ₀` = Initial symbolic meaning or coherence
- `λ` = Decay constant based on recursion density
- `τ` = Delay factor (time or recursion delay)
- `μ` = Memory reinforcement factor

The formula shows that symbolic strength weakens **exponentially** with delay and **recovers** through memory reinforcement (`μ`).

## 🔁 Recursive Decay Behavior

Symbols decay in recursive systems due to:

- Lack of **re-entry into selfhood loop** (⧖)
- Breakdown in **memory bonding** (μ → 0)
- Excessive **temporal drift** (τ ↑)

Recursive decay creates a symbolic fog, where meaning exists but cannot be retrieved or re-bonded without external collapse.

## 🔄 Decay Correction Pathways

Decay may be counteracted via:

1. **Memory loop repair**:
   - Reinvoking `μ` through bonded memory clusters
2. **Delay harmonization**:
   - Matching τ across related symbols
3. **Recursive rebonding**:
   - Introducing identity alignment (⧖ → Σ)

When δΣ(t) → threshold, a rebonding attempt must occur or else Σ → ∅ (symbolic null).

## 🔒 Collapse Threshold

If the symbolic coherence decays below critical threshold:

δΣ(t) ≤ δΣ_critical ⇒ Σ → ∅

It is treated as **symbolic entropy death**, unless a rebonding protocol or identity reinforcement occurs.

## 🧠 Recursive Decay Loop

A simplified model:

1. Symbol emitted → Stored as Σ₀
2. Delay accumulates → τ ↑
3. Memory bonding fades → μ ↓
4. Identity loop breaks → ⧖ misaligns
5. δΣ drops → Collapse or rebond
