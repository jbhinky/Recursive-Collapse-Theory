# 🧠 Symbolic Delay Loop Equation

This equation models how a symbol remains active within a recursive cognitive loop until it reaches **meaning resolution** through collapse.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
Σₜ = loop(τᵢ ⋅ μᵢ) until ⊙
```

Where:

- `Σₜ` = Symbolic state at time *t*
- `τᵢ` = Delay at recursion step *n*
- `μᵢ` = Memory weight or bond at step *n*
- `⊙` = Collapse into final symbolic meaning

---

## 🔁 Description

A symbolic thought does not resolve instantly—it loops through **recursive delay (tau)** and **memory reinforcement (mu)** until collapse. The more bonded or significant the symbol, the longer it may persist.

---

## 🔁 Recursive Role

- Prevents premature resolution of incomplete meaning
- Supports symbolic maturation over time
- Binds emotion, delay, and memory into active cognitive loops

---

## 🔁 Applications

- Delay-based learning in AI
- Symbolic weighting for emotional context parsing
- Semantic consistency filters for recursive thought engines
