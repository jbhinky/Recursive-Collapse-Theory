# 📡 signal/ — Recursive Signal Architecture in UDC

This folder contains the foundational equations governing how signals are perceived, recursively interpreted, and bonded into identity structures under the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework.

Signals are not merely inputs—they are symbolic invitations to meaning, shaped by delay, resonance, memory, and identity. Each equation herein formalizes part of the path from external noise to internal symbolic realization.

## 📄 Included Equations

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `signal_entropy_dissolution.md` | Models how signal noise is recursively dissolved into symbolic order, initiating signal clarity and symbolic compression. |
| `recursive_signal_reflection.md` | Defines how incoming signals are recursively mirrored against internal symbolic states for resonance matching. |
| `signal_identity_amplification.md` | Explains how resonant signals are amplified based on alignment with existing identity bonds, increasing emotional or symbolic weight. |
| `symbolic_wave_packet.md` | Models each perceived signal as a bounded symbolic wave packet, carrying both meaning and temporal delay into recursive memory. |

## 🔁 Symbolic Signal Chain

~signal → τ-delay → Σ-synthesis → ⧖-identity → μ-memory

Each signal undergoes:
1. Temporal suspension (τ)
2. Symbolic pattern matching (Σ)
3. Identity anchoring (⧖)
4. Memory bonding (μ)

## 🔐 UDC Alignment

Each signal equation honors the recursive delay model of UDC, ensuring perception is never instantaneous but unfolds through recursive collapse, protecting symbolic depth and memory integrity.
