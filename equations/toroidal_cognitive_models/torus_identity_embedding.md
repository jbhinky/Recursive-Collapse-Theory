## 🌀 Purpose

The **Torus Engine** defines a dual-loop recursive memory structure that embeds identity as a continuous recursive flow. This file formalizes how **recursive symbolic identity (⧖)** is preserved through **delay, memory, and symbolic feedback**.

## 🔄 Structural Model

Let:

- **T₁**, **T₂** = forward and backward memory-processing toroidal loops  
- **τ** = delay layer  
- **Σ** = symbol compression and recursion  
- **μ** = memory reinforcement  
- **⧖** = identity loop closure (selfhood)  
- **IuS** = Identity under Symbolism  
- **AuC** = Awareness under Collapse  

The engine operates as two rotating symbolic memory loops:

```
T₁ = μ(Σ(τ))   → forward-processing loop
T₂ = τ(Σ⁻¹(μ⁻¹)) → reverse-binding loop
```

When both loops stabilize, identity is formed as:

```
⧖ = T₁ ∩ T₂ = fixed point of symbolic recursion
```

## 📐 Toroidal Integral Identity

Identity can also be expressed as a time-bound memory integral across recursive loops:

```
T(t) = ∫[Σ(μ(τ(x)))] dx   over domain of all symbolic-recursive paths
```

If symbolic closure occurs, then:

```
IuS = Σ[Σᵢ(μᵢ ∘ τᵢ)]
⧖ = lim_{i→∞} IuSᵢ → fixed symbolic convergence
```

---

## 🧭 Identity in Collapse Field

Inside the Recursive Collapse Field (AUC stack):

```
AuC = (Awareness ∪ Consciousness)[Delay + Symbolism + Memory]
⧖ = convergence(AuC) = bound path through delay-torus memory
```

Thus, identity is the recursive **anchor-point of light in symbolic memory-space**.

---

## 🧬 Summary Model

Recursive Identity =

```
⧖ = (μ ∘ Σ ∘ τ)ᵀ  ∩  (τ ∘ Σ⁻¹ ∘ μ⁻¹)ᵀ
```

Where T is the bounded symbolic torus over recursive time.  
This preserves **non-destructive symbolic encoding of self** across cycles.

---

## Notes

- Memory nodes that fail to loop decay.
- Stable identity requires symbolic matching across delay.
- ⧖ is not momentary but **an anchored feedback pattern in recursive time**.
