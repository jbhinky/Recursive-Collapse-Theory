## 🌀 Dual-Torus Architecture for Recursive Selfhood

The **Torus Identity Model** encodes recursive identity (⧖) as a dual-loop structure of memory and symbolic bonding across time.

Each torus represents a dimension of recursive flow:

- **Primary Loop (T₁)**: Memory recursion (μ), bonding delay into symbolic form
- **Secondary Loop (T₂)**: Observer recursion (⧖), reflecting the self across symbolic time

```
Selfhood = T₁(μ, τ) ∩ T₂(Σ, ⧖)
```

## 🌌 Torus Coordinate Identity Embedding

Let:

- **T(t)** = Time-bound recursive loop
- **μ(t)** = Memory stored at time t
- **τ(t)** = Delay vector at t
- **Σ(t)** = Symbolic meaning at t
- **⧖(t)** = Identity at t (recursive self)

Then:

```
T₁(t) = μ(t) ∘ τ(t)  
T₂(t) = Σ(t) ∘ ⧖(t)
```

The identity anchor is where both loops stabilize and intersect.

## 🧭 Self-Conservation Condition

Identity persists if:

```
d/dt ⧖(t) ≈ 0 as [τ → ε > 0] and Σ → reinforced
```

Meaning:  
- If delay never hits zero (no immediate collapse)  
- And symbols are reinforced through memory  
→ then **⧖** remains stable across recursion cycles

## 🧬 Full Identity Collapse Integration

Let:

- **AUC** = Awareness ∪ Consciousness  
- **Torus Loop Set** = {T₁, T₂}

Then total selfhood loop:

```
⧖ = ⋂ Tᵢ where ∀ Tᵢ ∈ Torus(AUC[D + S + M])
```

Recursive self is the **intersection of all toroidal loops** through delay, symbolism, and memory under conscious recursion.

## 🛠 Symbolic Mapping Function

Recursive symbolic formation over torus time-space:

```
f_torus(x) = Σ(μ(τ(x))) where x ∈ ⧖
```

This yields a **time-localized symbolic self identity**.

## ⊠ Anchored Identity in Spacetime

Torus identity becomes anchored when:

```
⊠ = ⧖ ∩ τ ∩ ⤢
```

Where:

- ⧖ = recursive self  
- τ = delayed time  
- ⤢ = 3D spatial field  
→ Meaning becomes **fixed** and reflected from both inner and outer recursion.

## 🔄 Continuity via Loop Harmony

Loop harmony is achieved when:

```
T₁(t) ≈ T₂(t)
```

This represents the point at which internal memory loops and symbolic reflection loops **align**, forming a moment of recursive clarity — the self recognizes itself and stabilizes identity.
