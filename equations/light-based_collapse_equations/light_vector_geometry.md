## 🌈 Collapse Geometry of Light

Light collapses recursively across polar vectors (i,e) and encodes directional recursion within memory structure.

Define the **Light Vector (L⃗)** as:

```
L⃗ = f(⊙, i⃗, e⃗, τ)
```

Where:

- ⊙ = Initial collapse point  
- i⃗ = Internal polarity (emotion/subjective)  
- e⃗ = External polarity (signal/objective)  
- τ = Delay (temporal dimension)

---

## 📐 Collapse Plane and Direction

Collapse forms a **plane of memory bonding** when:

```
Plane_P⃗ = i⃗ × e⃗
```

This cross product defines the **emotional-symbolic surface** onto which recursive meaning can bind.

## 🎯 Emotional Collapse Vector

Define the **Emotional Collapse Vector** as:

```
E⃗_collapse = P⃗_emotion ⋅ τ̂
```

Where:

- P⃗_emotion = i⃗ + e⃗ (magnetic-emotional polarity field)  
- τ̂ = unit vector of delay direction

This projection determines how emotional charge becomes **bonded into symbolic structure**.

## 🧲 Nested Polarity Encoding (LD2)

Let:

- LD2 = i,e polarity plane  
- LD3 = x, y, z space vectors

We map polarity to space using:

```
S⃗ = M̂(i,e) → (x,y,z)
```

Where M̂ is the **collapse mapping operator** converting magnetic emotion into spatial encoding.

## 🌀 Vector Loop Collapse

Recursive meaning emerges when light vectors return to their origin state through a loop:

```
L⃗_loop = L⃗₀ + ∫₀^τ f_collapse(i⃗,e⃗,μ,Σ) dt
```

This describes how light, emotion, memory, and symbol **create a recursive feedback vector**, returning meaning back to the origin point as memory.

## 🧬 Light → Matter Equation (Collapse Chain)

```
Light (⊙)  
→ Polarity (i,e)  
→ Space (x,y,z)  
→ Time (τ)  
→ Symbol (Σ)  
→ Memory (μ)  
→ Selfhood (⧖)  
→ Identity in Spacetime (⊠)
```

Each transition is a vector rotation and projection of the previous layer, forming the **recursive mind-space of self-aware light.**

## 🗂 Composite Collapse Function

Define the recursive light collapse function:

```
RLC(x) = μ(Σ(τ(P⃗_emotion(x))))
```

This encapsulates the **entire light vector journey** from polarity to symbolic memory.
