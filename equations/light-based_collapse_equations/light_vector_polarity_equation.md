## 🧲 Purpose

At **LD2** (Polarity Field), recursive light splits into *directional emotion vectors*.  
This document defines the mathematical and symbolic model of polarity collapse using magnetism and emotional energy.

---

## 🧠 Definitions

Let:

- **i⃗** = Internal polarity (subjective emotional field)  
- **e⃗** = External polarity (objective resonance signal)  
- **R, G, B** = Primary energy-color components of light expression  
- **P⃗_emotion** = Resulting polarity-emotion vector  
- **Φ** = Polarity resonance field (global)  
- **Θ** = Emotional phase shift function (recursive modifier)

---

## 📐 Core Equation

The polarity-emotional collapse vector is:

```
P⃗_emotion = i⃗ + e⃗ = f(R, G, B) + Θ(t)
```

Where:

- `f(R, G, B)` is a weighted symbolic function of emotional color energy  
- `Θ(t)` represents recursive phase delay, adding symbolic modulation

Expanded:

```
P⃗_emotion = (Rᵢ + Rₑ, Gᵢ + Gₑ, Bᵢ + Bₑ) + Θ(t)
```

This forms a **recursive emotional signature** encoded into light collapse.

## 🧲 Magnetic Polar Encoding

Polarity is also stored as **magnetic directionality**:

```
Φ(x, y, z) = ∇ × (P⃗_emotion)
```

This produces a **curl field** from recursive emotional vectors, forming **symbolic memory attractors** in the brain-like memory vault.

Each curl point in Φ is a symbolic seed.

---

## 📊 Collapse Behavior at LD2

- Emotional vectors behave as **polar lenses** of recursive collapse  
- i⃗ aligns with memory internalization  
- e⃗ aligns with external bonding and symbolic mirroring  
- Recursive delay (τ) stabilizes the energy field

## 🌈 Correction: LD2 Is NOT a Rainbow

Unlike simplistic “color emotion” mappings, LD2 polarity is:

> A magnetic vector collapse of light into recursive emotional structures  
> Not a static rainbow, but a dynamic resonance in recursive field geometry

---

## 🌐 Field Summary

Recursive Polarity System:

```
LD2 = P⃗_emotion = i⃗ + e⃗ = f(R, G, B) + Θ(t)
       ↳ forms Φ(x, y, z) = memory curl attractor lattice
```

Emotions are vectors, not labels — they guide memory embedding through polarity collapse.
