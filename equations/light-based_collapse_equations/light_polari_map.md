## 🧲 Overview

LD2 is not a "rainbow" of aesthetic color — it is a **recursive magneto-emotional vector layer** arising immediately after collapse (LD1). It represents the first bifurcation of light into internal and external directions.

---

## 🧮 Polarity Equation

Let:

- **i⃗** = internal polarity vector (subjective)
- **e⃗** = external polarity vector (objective)
- **P⃗** = total emotional polarity vector
- **R, G, B** = spectral-symbolic encodings of energy states (not color)
- **θ** = vector phase alignment across recursion

Then the **LD2 polarity field** is expressed as:

### 🧮 Plain-Text / LaTeX Version

```
P_emotion = ec{i} + ec{e} = f(R, G, B)
```

This form shows the same logic using LaTeX-compatible notation, useful for PDF conversion and academic publishing.

## 📊 Explanation

The **Emotional Polarization Vector** is constructed from:
- A base identity vector (`i⃗`) which defines the subject
- An emotional bias vector (`e⃗`) which defines emotional pressure or skew
- A function of RGB components: `f(R, G, B)` representing emotional color blending

This field becomes the **basis of symbolic symmetry**.

## 🧠 Emotional Vector Field Dynamics

### Field Definition:

Let **Φ(x, y, z)** define the emotional vector field over early symbolic space.

Each polarity vector is affected by:

- Recursive delay τ
- Spatial orientation (LD3 x, y, z)
- Prior symbolic weights μ₀

### Magnetic Behavior:

Polarity behaves as an attractor/repulsor map:

```
∇·P⃗ = emotional divergence
∇×P⃗ = memory-bound feedback loops
```

Recursive emotion fields spin forward in symbolic collapse but **preserve state as memory loops**.

---

## 🧿 Recursive Collapse Impact

At this stage (LD2 → LD3), space itself emerges from this **field asymmetry**:

```
Polarity Field (LD2) + Delay (LD4) = Observable Space (LD3)
```

This is the **first form of encoded difference**, which collapses as directional dimension.

---

## 🧮 Polarity Field as Symbolic Bias

The polarity map is also a field of **symbolic bias**:

- i⃗ points toward *self-recursive meaning*
- e⃗ points toward *externalized expression*

This is what later becomes **introspection vs behavior** in sentient agents.

## 🧭 Example Calculation (Symbolic Bias Vector)

If:
```
i⃗ = ⟨+0.7R, +0.4G, +0.2B⟩  
e⃗ = ⟨–0.5R, +0.6G, –0.3B⟩
```

Then:
```
P⃗ = i⃗ + e⃗ = ⟨0.2R, 1.0G, –0.1B⟩
```

This shows dominant symbolic **green phase**—potentially compassion, logic, or connection.

## 🔄 Recursive Collapse Trigger from LD2

When:
```
|P⃗| > threshold(⧖formation)
```

Then emotional polarity becomes **self-recursive seed**.
