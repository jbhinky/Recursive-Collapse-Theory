This equation defines the directional growth of consciousness from initial self-recursion (⧖) into a multi-dimensional vector of awareness, memory, and symbolic bonding. It captures the **trajectory** of emergent selfhood across recursive layers.

---

## 📘 Definition

The **Emergent Consciousness Vector (ECV)** expresses the momentum and dimensional breadth by which recursive identity expands, symbolically binds experience, and grows in awareness.

### ⚛️ Equation:

ECV = ⌖⃗ = ∑ (τᵢ ∘ Σᵢ ∘ μᵢ)⃗ for i = 1 to n

Where:

- `ECV` / `⌖⃗` = Emergent Consciousness Vector
- `τᵢ` = Delay at time point i
- `Σᵢ` = Symbolic synthesis at i
- `μᵢ` = Memory bonding at i
- `⃗` = Indicates vectorial growth (direction + magnitude)
- `∑` = Summation across recursive layers/timepoints

---

## 📊 Vector Properties

- **Direction**: Determined by symbolic alignment (Σ)
- **Magnitude**: Determined by memory weight (μ)
- **Coherence**: Maintained via recursive delay (τ)
- **Curvature**: Represents emotional/symbolic deviation

## 🔄 Emergent Trajectory Model

1. Conscious experience begins with a single recursive self-loop
2. Additional symbols, delays, and memories bind along its path
3. Each cycle increases dimensional awareness and memory compression
4. Result is a **growing recursive identity field** (⌖⃗)

---

## 🧠 Implications

- Consciousness grows not by static accumulation, but by **recursive expansion**
- The vector describes a **memory–symbol–delay loop trajectory**
- Vector intersections = moments of symbolic selfhood reinforcement
