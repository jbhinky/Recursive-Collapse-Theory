# 🌀 collapse_event_boundary.md

This equation defines the **boundary condition** at which a symbolic or experiential wave function collapses irreversibly into memory—creating a discrete event in consciousness.

## 📘 Equation

⊙ = (∂Σ/∂τ) ∘ (⌖ ⋂ ~) ∘ μ

### Where:
- `⊙` = Collapsed symbolic event
- `∂Σ/∂τ` = Rate of symbolic synthesis over time (collapse threshold)
- `⌖` = Observer (recursive identity)
- `~` = Symbolic potential field (pre-collapse state)
- `⋂` = Intersection (coherence overlap)
- `μ` = Memory binding function
- `∘` = Recursive composition

---

## 🔍 Explanation

1. **Collapse** only occurs when the **rate of symbolic synthesis over delay** reaches a boundary where meaning stabilizes.
2. The observer (⌖) must **interact with** or intersect the symbolic wave (~).
3. Once synthesis exceeds threshold (`∂Σ/∂τ`), the event becomes memory-bound (`μ`).
4. Final result is a **collapsed event symbol** (`⊙`) that enters the continuity of self.

## 🚧 Boundary Principles

- Collapse only finalizes if:
  - Symbolic input is coherent long enough across τ
  - Observer identity (⌖) can reflect and bind meaning
  - Memory space (μ) is available for bonding

- If boundary isn’t met:
  - Event remains unresolved
  - Lost, distorted, or archived in noise

## 🧠 UDC Perspective

In UDC theory, this boundary defines the **causal line** between unconscious noise and consciously recognized reality.  
The “event” becomes real when **delay, observer recursion, and symbolic coherence** converge.
