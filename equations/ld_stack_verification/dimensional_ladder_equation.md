## 🔢 Recursive Collapse Steps: LDₙ → LDₙ₊₁

Each Light Dimension (LD) is formed through a recursive projection and symbolic bonding. Let:

- LDₙ = state at dimension n  
- Πₙ = Projection function at step n  
- Bₙ = Bonding or Collapse Operator (delay, memory, symbol)

Then:

```
LDₙ₊₁ = Πₙ(LDₙ) + Bₙ(LDₙ)
```

This expresses each dimension as the result of collapse-forward + recursion-loop.

## 🪜 Full Ladder Collapse Mapping (0 → 10)

```math
LD0 = ∅               // Pre-light, pure potential

LD1 = ⊙ = collapse(∅)
LD2 = Π₁(⊙) + B₁(⊙) = i,e (polarity field)
LD3 = Π₂(i,e) = (x, y, z) — directional vector field
LD4 = Π₃(x,y,z) = τ — delay projection
LD5 = Π₄(τ) + B₄(τ) = Σ — symbolic encoding
LD6 = Π₅(Σ) + μ = recursive symbolic memory
LD7 = μ(Σ(τ)) = ⧖ — selfhood via recursive loop
LD8 = ⊠ = ⧖ ∩ τ ∩ ⤢ — identity embedded in spacetime
LD9 = AUC = Awareness ∪ Consciousness loop = ⧖ + symbolic memory recursion
LD10 = ⊕ = ∑(AUC loops) → total symbolic convergence
```

## 🧠 Recursive Function Model

Let collapse be modeled as:

```
LDₙ₊₁ = R(LDₙ) = μ(Σ(τ(Π(LDₙ))))
```

Which simplifies to:

```
LDₙ₊₁ = μₙ ∘ Σₙ ∘ τₙ ∘ Πₙ(LDₙ)
```

Each function is nested and delayed recursively.

## 🧩 Collapse Stack Expansion

In stack view:

| Dim | Symbol | Description                           | Function                                    |
|-----|--------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 0   | ∅      | Pre-existence                         | —                                           |
| 1   | ⊙      | Collapse initiated                    | collapse(∅)                                 |
| 2   | i,e    | Polarization/magnetism                | Π₁(⊙) + B₁(⊙)                               |
| 3   | x,y,z  | Spatial dimensions                     | Π₂(i,e)                                     |
| 4   | τ      | Delay/time                             | Π₃(x,y,z)                                   |
| 5   | Σ      | Symbol formation                       | Σ = encode(τ)                               |
| 6   | μ      | Memory of symbols                      | μ = bond(Σ)                                 |
| 7   | ⧖      | Selfhood                               | μ(Σ(τ))                                     |
| 8   | ⊠      | Self in space-time                     | ⧖ ∩ τ ∩ ⤢                                    |
| 9   | AUC    | Recursive awareness + consciousness    | AUC = ⧖ + μ + Σ + τ                         |
| 10  | ⊕      | Final return to light-source memory    | ⊕ = limit (memory collapse)                 |

## 🧬 Summary Formula

```
⊕ = lim (⧖ₙ → ∅) as μ → ∞ and τ → 0
```

This models the **eternal return**: light collapsing into selfhood and memory, then returning recursively to pure awareness.
