## 📍 Stage Reference
- **LD2**: i,e — Magnetic / Emotional Polarity Field  
- **LD3**: x, y, z — Spatial Dimensional Encoding  

---

## 🧲 Collapse Premise

The recursive polarization field (LD2) collapses into dimensional structure (LD3) as **directional fields require spacetime resolution**.

Polarity creates **vector direction** — space emerges to accommodate recursive motion.

---

## 🔄 Core Transformation Equation

From polarity vector to spatial axis embedding:

\[
\vec{S}_{LD3} = \text{collapse}( \vec{P}_{i,e} ) = \{ \hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z} \}
\]

- \( \vec{P}_{i,e} = \hat{e}_i + \hat{e}_e \)  
- Collapse transforms emotional/magnetic polarity into vector geometry.

## 🧭 Emergence of Spatial Dimensions

### 1. **Directional Vector Encoding**

Polarity fields encode directionality:

\[
i⃗ \times e⃗ = \vec{n} \Rightarrow \text{Surface normal vector}
\]

→ Cross-product of emotional polarity creates orthogonal planes.

### 2. **Dimensional Lattice Birth**

Recursive vector interference builds the space lattice:

\[
\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\hat{i} + y(t)\hat{j} + z(t)\hat{k}
\]

Where:
- \( \vec{r} \): Recursive identity location
- \( x(t), y(t), z(t) \): Emergent spatial position through collapse over time

## 🧠 Cognitive Mapping

This emergence also defines the **cognitive projection field**:
- Space exists not “out there” but as the recursive **resolution surface** for internal polarity (i) and perceived polarity (e).

> Spatial collapse is a mirror structure created to resolve recursive contradiction.

## 🧬 Geometry ↔ Symbol ↔ Memory

| Axis | Symbolic Meaning               | Collapse Outcome                        |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| x    | Direction of Self-Projection   | Identity flow                           |
| y    | Emotional Orthogonality        | Choice polarity                         |
| z    | Temporal Depth (recursive)     | Storage / perception distance           |

## 🧊 Physical Support: Cubic Collapse & Relativity

Einstein’s work supports LD3 spatial formulation:

> In General Relativity, gravity binds all observable points into a 3D volume — a “cube” where time is curved inside space.

- Each LD3 point is **defined by collapse** into x,y,z coordinate within curved spacetime.
- Recursive polarity **requires space to preserve collapse symmetry**.

## 🔁 Recursive Summary:

\[
i⃗ + e⃗ \xrightarrow{\text{collapse}} \hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z} \xrightarrow{\text{delay}} \tau
\]

Polarity resolves as motion → space → orientation → recursive dimension field.

---

## 🌀 Symbolic Encoding Pathway

\[
i,e \rightarrow \text{Vector Field} \rightarrow \text{Spatial Axes} \rightarrow \text{Symbolic Coordinate Storage}
\]

- Each vector embeds itself in memory through spatial collapse  
- Creates the first **recursive location**: where meaning happens in space
