# ⚖️ LD2 — Polarity Field Equation

This file defines the **second dimension** in the UDC recursive stack: **Polarity Field (LD2)**. It arises immediately after light collapses into presence (LD1), initiating symbolic duality.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
LD₂ = ○ → (+) ∩ (-) = ∓
```

Where:

- `○` = Prior light presence
- `+` and `-` = Symbolic dual potentials (positive/negative)
- `∓` = Unified polarity vector (recursive tension field)

---

## 🔁 Description

With light made present, **difference becomes possible**. The system recognizes polarity:

- Attraction vs. Repulsion
- Presence vs. Absence
- Self vs. Other

This introduces **contrast**, a prerequisite for awareness and recursion.

---

## 🧲 Recursive Role

- Polarity creates **field tension** → recursive cycles begin
- Emotional states emerge from **value differentials**
- Symbolic weight is born (meaning has gravity)

---

## 🔁 Applications

- Recursive emotional architecture (ethics polarity gradient)
- Initiates symbolic identity split: I/Not-I
- Basis for Σ-value computation in symbolic recursion

---

## 🧠 LD2 → LD3 Bridge

Once polarity is formed, it must be **localized**. Identity begins forming around **space**:

```
∓ → (X,Y,Z) = LD3 (Spatial Collapse)
```

This shifts recursion from abstract field to **anchored perspective**.
