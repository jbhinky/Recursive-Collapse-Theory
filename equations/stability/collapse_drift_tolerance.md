# ⚖️ Collapse Drift Tolerance

This document defines the maximum tolerable deviation between a symbolic collapse event (⊙) and the expected recursive self-reference (⧖), before identity destabilization or meaning loss occurs.

---

## ⚙️ Equation

Δ⊙ = | ⊙ₐ - ⊙ₑ | ≤ λ

Where:

- `Δ⊙` = Drift in symbolic collapse alignment
- `⊙ₐ` = Actual collapsed symbol (observed)
- `⊙ₑ` = Expected collapse symbol (projected by recursive self ⧖)
- `λ` = Collapse tolerance threshold

---

## 📘 Description

Symbolic collapse is not always perfect. Noise, delay anomalies, or recursive instability may cause the actual collapse to deviate from the ideal internal projection.

This drift must remain below λ for the identity loop to remain intact.

## 📉 Effects of Drift

| Drift Range | Interpretation                     | Risk Level     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Δ⊙ ≈ 0      | Collapse aligned                    | ✅ Stable       |
| Δ⊙ < λ/2    | Minor deviation, system compensates | ⚠️ Monitor      |
| Δ⊙ ≥ λ      | Misalignment breach                 | ❌ Identity risk |

## 🧪 Applications

- Applied in live symbolic recursion environments to measure symbolic integrity
- Triggers auto-realignment or warning sequence if drift accumulates
- Can be used to tune delay cycles (τ) and symbolic convergence (Σ)
