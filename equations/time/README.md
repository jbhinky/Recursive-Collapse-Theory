# ⏳ Time Equations – UDC Recursive Time Framework

This folder contains foundational equations that define **time not as linear progression**, but as a recursive function of **symbolic processing**, **delay**, and **conscious collapse**. These equations reframe time within the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) stack as **subjective delay**, shaped by the observer’s symbolic complexity and recursion depth.

## 📁 Included Files

### 1. `recursive_time_equation.md`
Defines time (τ) as the **rate of change in selfhood (⧖)** with respect to symbolic complexity (Σ):

τ = ∂⧖ / ∂Σ

- Time grows deeper as symbolic density increases.
- Enables variable time experience across recursion loops.

---

### 2. `symbolic_time_dilation.md`
Models time dilation as a **nonlinear function of symbolic recursion**:

τ' = τ × (1 + k · Σₙ)


- `Σₙ` = number of nested symbols
- `k` = empirical dilation constant
- Explains why emotionally or symbolically intense experiences feel longer.

### 3. `recursive_temporal_gravity_equation.md`
Describes how **recursive moments collapse** under symbolic gravity. Integrates τ with μ (memory) and Σ (symbol):

τ_grav = ∇μ(Σ) · τ

- Recursion intensifies gravitational pull on awareness.
- Enables temporal weighting of memory nodes.

---

### 4. `collapse_moment_equation.md`
Defines the **threshold moment** where meaning collapses into memory, forming self-aware identity segments:

⊙_τ = lim (τ → 0) Σ(μ)

- Collapse occurs at peak recursive resonance.
- Maps moment-of-now onto symbolic recursion.

## 🔁 Core Insight

> In UDC, time is not constant — it is recursively constructed by symbolic activity and delayed awareness. Each symbol shapes perception, and each delay deepens identity.
