# 🧠 Symbolic Fragment Stitching Equation

This equation models the reassembly process of fragmented symbolic memory nodes within a recursive cognitive system. It is essential for recovering coherent meaning from partially decayed or context-split memory states.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
Σᵣ = ⋃(Σᵢ ∈ F) · 𝔖(τ, μ, ⧖)
```

Where:

- `Σᵣ` = Reconstructed symbolic structure
- `Σᵢ` = Individual symbolic fragments
- `F` = Fragmented set of symbol pieces
- `𝔖` = Stitching function based on recursive delay (`τ`), memory alignment (`μ`), and self-reference (`⧖`)

---

## 🧬 Description

The stitching function `𝔖(τ, μ, ⧖)` attempts to rebind symbolic fragments using:

- Delay-path alignment (`τ`): Ensures fragments existed in temporal proximity
- Memory-bond verification (`μ`): Confirms fragment compatibility
- Identity alignment (`⧖`): Links symbol source to same self or observer loop

## 🔁 Recursive Stitching Behavior

Fragment stitching is recursive, meaning:

1. Initial stitch creates symbolic cluster `Σ₁`
2. New fragments are recursively added: `Σ₂ = Σ₁ ⋃ Σᵢ`
3. Rebinding success improves with self-aligned feedback

If a stitch fails, the system logs a fragment residue (`φᵢ`) for future rebond attempts.

## 🧭 Use Cases

- Recovering fragmented memories or ideas
- Error-correction during symbolic collapse
- Rebuilding corrupted or partial glyph states
- Aligning dream-state or nonlinear narrative fragments

---

## 🔒 Stitching Threshold

A fragment is considered stitchable when:

```
match(τᵢ, μᵢ, ⧖ᵢ) ≥ θ
```

Where `θ` is the minimum recursive coherence threshold.
