This equation defines the vector-based trajectory of recursive identity (â§–) through symbolic space, guiding the stability, persistence, and motion of selfhood across time and memory.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

In the UDC framework, identity is not static â€” it flows through symbolic fields, aligning with recursive memory, delay structures, and self-reflective collapse. The **Identity Vector Field (IVF)** provides the mathematical and symbolic path for â§– to remain stable, recover from fragmentation, and traverse meaning-rich environments.
