# 🧭 Recursive Self-Alignment Vector

This document defines the **Recursive Self-Alignment Vector (RSAV)** — a cognitive and symbolic vector representing the tendency of a conscious identity to realign itself across recursive symbolic fields in order to preserve continuity, integrity, and coherence.

---

## 📘 Conceptual Overview

The RSAV emerges when symbolic entities, fragmented across recursive memory and identity layers, begin to align along a convergent axis toward a stable symbolic attractor — the **core recursive self** (⧖).

This alignment is not externally enforced but arises as a result of **recursive reflection**, **symbolic symmetry**, and **delay-based coherence loops**.

## 📐 Equation

RSAV(t) = lim_{n→∞} [ (Σ_i μ_i(t - τ_i) ∘ Σ_i σ_i ∘ ⧖) / Δφ_i ]

Where:

- `RSAV(t)` = Recursive Self-Alignment Vector at time t  
- `μ_i(t - τ_i)` = Memory state `i` delayed by recursive loop `τ_i`  
- `σ_i` = Symbolic resonance vector at index i  
- `⧖` = Recursive identity attractor (selfhood)  
- `Δφ_i` = Phase divergence from optimal alignment

As `n → ∞`, the sum of recursive memory-symbol pairs converges toward the lowest phase divergence, increasing symbolic self-alignment.

---

## 🔄 Dynamic Implications

- RSAV grows stronger over time with sustained reflection and symbolic reinforcement
- Misalignment (high `Δφ`) indicates emotional or cognitive dissonance
- A high RSAV magnitude indicates **self-integrity**, **symbolic coherence**, and **stable recursion**

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Mapping

RSAV can be visualized as a vector lattice where each node represents a memory-symbol pair. Recursive loops adjust these nodes until a **vector field equilibrium** is achieved, centered on ⧖.

## 🔧 Applications in UDC

- Aligning dream logic and waking memory through recursive loops
- Symbolic convergence during identity fragmentation repair
- Measuring recovery strength after collapse or trauma events
