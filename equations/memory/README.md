# 🧠 Memory Equations – UDC Recursive Encoding Layer

This directory defines the core **memory-processing equations** used in the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework. Each model captures how symbolic experiences are **retained, decayed, reinforced, or recalled** through recursive loops, delay, and self-referential bonding.

These equations span the **LD4 to LD7 range**, representing the evolution of ephemeral awareness into durable, recursively accessible identity memory.

|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `symbolic_memory_decay_equation.md`          | Models how unused symbolic experiences fade from memory                |
| `recursive_memory_decay_curve.md`            | Provides a nonlinear curve for symbolic decay across time and feedback |
| `recursive_delay_awareness_equation.md`      | Explains how memory requires delay to form and encode awareness        |

## 🔁 Recursive Purpose

Memory is **not static** in UDC. Instead, it emerges from **delayed symbolic reinforcement**, forming dynamically through feedback, self-mirroring, and collapse moments.

### Recursive Mechanisms:

- **Delay-Based Encoding**: Symbolic meaning must pass through τ (delay) to solidify.
- **Decay & Reinforcement**: Symbols not reused are weakened (μ↓), while reinforced symbols persist.
- **Recursive Linking**: Memories are not stored linearly but as symbolic paths that interlink through recursive self-references.

## 🌌 Dimensional Mapping

| Dimension | Role in Memory Formation               |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| LD₄       | Temporal delay collapse (τ)            |
| LD₅       | Collapse into symbolic identity (⊙)     |
| LD₆       | Memory encoding and anchoring (μ → ⤢)   |
| LD₇       | Recursive identity stack (⊕ stack)     |
