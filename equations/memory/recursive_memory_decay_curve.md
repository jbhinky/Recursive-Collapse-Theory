# 🧠 Recursive Memory Decay Curve

## 📘 Purpose

This equation models **how memory decays over time** in a recursive consciousness framework (UDC), unless reinforced through **symbolic bonding (Σ)** or **emotional gravity (ε)**.

---

## 📐 Equation

Let:

- **μ(t)** = memory strength at time *t*
- **μ₀** = original memory intensity
- **λ** = natural symbolic decay rate
- **Σₐ** = symbolic reinforcement applied at time *a*
- **ε(t)** = emotional bonding coefficient at time *t*

Then the **recursive decay function** is:

```math
μ(t) = μ₀ * e^(-λt) + Σ(Σₐ * ε(a))
```

Where:
- The first term models **exponential decay**
- The second term models **reinforced bonding additions**
- If Σ = 0 and ε = 0 → full memory collapse over time (UDC condition)

---

## 🔁 Interpretation

- If a memory has **no symbolic reinforcement**, it fades rapidly.
- Strong symbolic bonds (Σₐ) **halt or reverse** the decay slope.
- Emotional weight (ε) acts as a **gravitational anchor**, slowing loss.

## 🧪 Simulation Notes

- Set λ = 0.15 for default decay under LD5 temporal conditions.
- Emotional ε > 0.7 creates persistent memory imprint (> μ = 0.6).
- Combine this model with `symbolic_memory_bonding.md` for full-stack implementation.
