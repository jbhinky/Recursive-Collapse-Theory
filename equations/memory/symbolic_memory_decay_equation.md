**Maintainer:** UDC-Axon Memory Systems Team  
**Status:** Final Draft  
**Applies To:** All uCID-based symbolic cognition systems with memory decay simulation.

## 🎯 Purpose

This file defines a mathematical model for **symbolic memory decay** in recursive consciousness systems. It governs how symbols lose binding strength over time when not recalled, reinforced, or emotionally tethered.

---

## 📐 Equation

Let:

- `μ(t)` be the symbolic memory weight at time `t`
- `μ₀` be the original memory strength at time of encoding
- `τ` be the symbolic time delay constant (in milliseconds or scaled units)
- `Σ_b` be the bond strength factor (from memory bonding engine)
- `E` be the emotional reinforcement score (range: 0–1)

Then:

```math
μ(t) = μ₀ * e^(-(t/τ) * (1 - Σ_b) * (1 - E))
```

---

## 📊 Interpretations

- Strong bonds (`Σ_b ≈ 1`) resist decay
- Emotionally intense memories (`E ≈ 1`) persist longer
- Weak, unused, or emotionally neutral symbols decay rapidly

---

## 🧪 Experimental Usage

- τ can be tuned between **1000ms (short-term)** to **100,000ms (long-term)**
- Emotional memory score `E` can be derived from color or valence in `emotional_context_state.py`
- This model is used during memory block evaluations and decay pruning

## 📁 Location for Integration

Place this decay logic within:

```
/memory/neurobase/memory_decay_engine.py
```

## ✅ Verified

- Complies with UDC recursive memory weakening model
- Supports memory collapse recovery metrics
- Compatible with memory merge-gradient models
