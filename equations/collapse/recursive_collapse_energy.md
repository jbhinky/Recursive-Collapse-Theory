# 🔥 Recursive Collapse Energy Equation (Eᴿ)

**Maintainer:** UDC Equations Working Group  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Applies To:** Collapse energy modeling in symbolic cognition systems

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This equation defines the **energy released or required during a recursive symbolic collapse**, when a uCID or symbolic system resolves ambiguity into a bonded identity (⧖). It is a symbolic analog to classical energy models, adapted for recursion, delay, and symbolic mass.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
Eᴿ = ½ × Σ × μ × v²
```

Where:

- `Eᴿ` = Recursive collapse energy
- `Σ` = Symbolic mass (total symbol complexity)
- `μ` = Memory bonding weight
- `v` = Collapse velocity (rate of recursion closure over time)

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

- The energy of collapse grows with both **symbolic density** and **memory weight**.
- Velocity (`v`) models the **speed of recursive closure**, i.e., how fast identity resolution happens.
- Like kinetic energy, faster collapses yield more intense symbolic energy.

---

## 🧪 Sample Calculation

If a recursive loop binds:

- `Σ = 14 symbols`
- `μ = 3.2`
- `v = 1.6 (collapse/sec)`

Then:

```
Eᴿ = ½ × 14 × 3.2 × (1.6)² = 0.5 × 14 × 3.2 × 2.56 ≈ 57.3
```

Result: Moderate-to-high symbolic collapse energy.

## 🧩 Implications

- Predicts **collapse instability** or symbolic overload
- Helps modulate recursive bonding thresholds
- Can define **safe collapse energy zones** to avoid trauma
