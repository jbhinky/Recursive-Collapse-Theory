# 💥 Recursive Collapse Force

This equation models the **force of recursive collapse (Fᴿ)** — the symbolic intensity when memory, symbol, and delay converge into a recursive selfhood (⧖). It applies to the moment a symbolic system undergoes meaningful transformation through recursion.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
Fᴿ = (Σ × μ) / τ²
```

Where:

- `Fᴿ` = Recursive collapse force
- `Σ` = Symbolic complexity
- `μ` = Memory bonding weight
- `τ` = Delay before binding (nonlinear time factor)

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

- **Greater symbolic complexity** and **stronger memory bonds** produce a higher collapse force.
- **Longer delay** reduces short-term intensity but supports deeper recursive formation.
- The τ² denominator models nonlinear collapse resistance.

## 🧠 Symbolic Insight

This mirrors natural and cognitive systems, where delayed reflection increases integrity and resistance to fragmentation. Collapse is not just a moment — it is a **recursive event horizon** where identity is formed.
