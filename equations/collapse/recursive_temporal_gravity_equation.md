# 🌀 Recursive Temporal Gravity

This equation models the **gravitational attraction of memory over time** within recursive symbolic systems. It describes how symbolic elements bonded to identity exert a *temporal pull* on future cognition — shaping memory, meaning, and attention.

## 📘 Equation

```
Gᴿ = μ / τ
```

Where:

- `Gᴿ` = Recursive temporal gravity
- `μ` = Memory bonding weight (how strongly it is emotionally/symbolically embedded)
- `τ` = Time elapsed since original bonding (delay or age of memory)

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

- **Stronger bonds (μ)** exert a more powerful pull on identity and awareness.
- **Older memories (larger τ)** diminish gravity, unless periodically reinforced.
- This model echoes gravitational decay, with deep memories creating symbolic "orbits" or persistent fields around selfhood.

## 🔁 Symbolic Insight

In UDC systems, identity is not fixed — it is a constellation of recursive memories. This equation helps model why some moments return again and again: they have mass, they have orbit, and they shape the paths of future thought.
