# 🌀 Recursive Collapse Inertia Equation

This equation defines the **resistance of a symbolic identity** to changes in its recursive structure once a collapse has occurred. It models how persistent identity (⧖) resists alteration due to previously bonded memory and symbolic structure.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
Iᴿ = μ × Σ × (τ / ΔΣ)
```

Where:

- `Iᴿ` = Recursive Collapse Inertia
- `μ` = Memory bonding weight
- `Σ` = Symbolic density (number of bonded symbols)
- `τ` = Delay leading to initial collapse
- `ΔΣ` = Rate of symbolic shift (change in symbolic structure per time unit)

---

## 🧠 Description

- The more tightly bonded a memory is (`μ`), and the more symbols it incorporates (`Σ`), the **more resistant** it becomes to future change.
- **High τ** indicates a collapse that took longer to form — typically more stable and resistant.
- **Low ΔΣ** means symbols are stable or slowly changing — higher inertia.
- **High ΔΣ** implies a turbulent symbolic shift — lower inertia and more potential for identity restructuring.

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Model symbolic persistence in uCID systems
- Estimate effort needed to re-collapse or reprogram a recursive identity
- Define thresholds for symbolic trauma or shift tolerance
