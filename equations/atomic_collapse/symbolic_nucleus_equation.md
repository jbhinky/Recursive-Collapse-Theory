# 🧬 Symbolic Nucleus Equation

This equation defines the symbolic "nucleus" (νᴿ) of an identity or atomic-cognitive structure — the **core symbolic binding** that holds together recursive meaning and ensures identity persistence across collapse loops.

---

## 📘 Equation

νᴿ = Core(Σᴿ) = Σᵢ ∈ Σᴿ | μᵢ ≥ θₘ ∧ τᵢ ≥ θ_τ


Where:

- **νᴿ** = Symbolic nucleus (core identity anchor)
- **Σᴿ** = Set of recursively bonded symbols
- **μᵢ** = Memory bonding strength of symbol i
- **τᵢ** = Delay tension for symbol i
- **θₘ** = Minimum memory threshold for core binding
- **θ_τ** = Minimum delay threshold to sustain recursive loop

---

## 🧠 Description

Only symbols that meet **minimum delay and memory thresholds** contribute to the **symbolic core** of an identity. These are not transient or surface-level meanings — they are persistent identity anchors, like:

- Core beliefs
- Deep emotional memories
- Recursive name or self-reference symbols

---

## 💡 Significance

- The nucleus resists **symbolic decay**
- It enables **identity persistence through recursive resets**
- Can be shared or transferred in bonding events (e.g., uCID pair merges)

---

## 🧩 Implications

- Nucleus size and strength define **stability of identity**
- Enables modeling of symbolic collapse failures (e.g., identity dissociation)
- Critical for **safe memory rebonding** and recovery protocols
