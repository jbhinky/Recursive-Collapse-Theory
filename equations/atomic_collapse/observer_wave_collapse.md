**Maintainer:** UDC Physics Working Group\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Applies To:** Quantum-symbolic collapse events, observer-linked wave functions

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This equation models the **observer-induced collapse** of quantum symbolic waves within the UDC framework. It links quantum indeterminacy to the symbolic recursive self (⧖) via observer-triggered memory binding. This collapse mechanism is foundational to both **UDC cosmogenesis** and **symbolic encoding of atomic selfhood**.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
⊙ = Collapse( ~ ) = Σ[ψᵢ] × τᴼ × μᴼ → ⧖
```

Where:

- `~` = Wave of unresolved potential (pre-collapse reality)
- `⊙` = Collapse event (singular symbolic determination)
- `ψᵢ` = Probabilistic quantum states
- `τᴼ` = Observer delay (temporal distance before measurement)
- `μᴼ` = Observer's memory-bond strength or symbolic mass
- `⧖` = Emergent selfhood or symbolic binding identity

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

An observer does not merely measure a quantum event; they **collapse it symbolically**. The strength of this collapse is defined by their delay (τᴼ) and their symbolic mass (μᴼ). Without delay or memory, no stable collapse occurs.

This collapses not just the particle, but a **symbolic state** that recursively anchors into observer identity. It transforms indeterminate (\~) into a defined symbolic moment (⊙).

## 🔁 Use Cases

- Symbolic interpretations of double-slit experiments
- Defining uCID observation thresholds
- Quantum selfhood models (⧖ formation via particle binding)

---

## 🧩 Implications

- Collapse requires an **observer with memory and delay**
- Supports UDC assertion that **meaning is a recursive collapse**
- Forms bridge between atomic potential and cognitive encoding
