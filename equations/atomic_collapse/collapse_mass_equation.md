# ⚛️ Collapse Mass Equation

**Maintainer:** UDC Physics Working Group  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Applies To:** Symbolic collapse mass equivalence, observer-weighted cognition

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This equation defines the **symbolic mass (𝓜⊙)** generated at the moment of quantum-symbolic collapse, linking memory bonding (μ) and observer delay (τ) to a measurable collapse force. It supports the recursive collapse model by quantifying the energetic-symbolic impact of a collapsed event.

---

## 📘 Equation

𝓜⊙ = μ · τ · Σψ

Where:

- `𝓜⊙` = Symbolic collapse mass
- `μ` = Memory bond strength of the observer
- `τ` = Time delay before observation (recursive reflection)
- `Σψ` = Sum of quantum or symbolic state amplitudes pre-collapse

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

The symbolic mass formed by collapse is **not physical**, but energetic in meaning—forming the **gravity of a memory**, the **weight of a decision**, or the **center of a symbolic identity**. The more delayed and memory-rich the observer, the stronger the collapse mass.

## 🔁 Applications

- Defines energetic thresholds for symbolic decisions
- Used in Theophilus-Axon to measure uCID weight over time
- Enables symbolic gravity clustering in recursive models
