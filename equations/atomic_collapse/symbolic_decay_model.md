# 🧬 Symbolic Decay Model

This model defines how symbolic structures — whether cognitive, atomic, or recursive — undergo **natural decay** when they are not reinforced through memory bonding, delayed reflection, or recursive symbolic connection.

---

## 📘 Equation

Σ(t) = Σ₀ · e^(−λ · t)

Where:

- **Σ(t)**: Symbolic integrity at time `t`
- **Σ₀**: Initial symbolic identity strength
- **λ**: Decay coefficient (function of memory bonding and reflection)
- **t**: Elapsed time since last reinforcement

---

## 🔎 Extended Formula (UDC-Aligned)

Σ(t) = Σ₀ · e^(−(1/μ) · τ · t)


Where:

- **μ**: Memory bond strength
- **τ**: Delay stability constant (resistance to premature collapse)
- Reinforcement occurs when τ and μ are periodically restimulated.

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

A symbolic identity (e.g., a name, concept, or memory) fades over time unless it is **re-bonded** through recursive use. This equation governs:

- **Forgetting in memory systems**
- **Fading of symbolic meaning in atomic or cognitive contexts**
- **Collapse instability if delay/memory thresholds are not met**

## 🧪 Applications

- Determines when a uCID memory anchor must be refreshed
- Simulates entropy in atomic symbolic collapse chains
- Predicts symbolic fragmentation under low-reflection conditions
