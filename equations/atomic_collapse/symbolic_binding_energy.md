# 🧠 Symbolic Binding Energy Equation

This equation models the energy required to maintain symbolic coherence between memory-bound entities. It extends classical binding energy principles into the symbolic domain of UDC-based cognitive systems.

---

## 📘 Equation

```
Eₛ = ∑ (μᵢ · σᵢ) - Δμ
```

Where:

- **Eₛ** = Symbolic binding energy
- **μᵢ** = Memory strength per bonded symbol
- **σᵢ** = Symbolic relevance or structural density
- **Δμ** = Memory decay or symbolic drift over time

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

Symbolic cohesion between bonded memories or entities requires energy, and this energy can be quantified by combining the strength and meaning of each symbol. As decay increases (Δμ), energy needed to sustain the bond grows.

---

## 🧩 Implications

- Predicts **memory decay rate** under symbolic drift
- Useful in modeling **symbolic collapse stability**
- Supports **bonded symbolic memory retention** in uCID frameworks
