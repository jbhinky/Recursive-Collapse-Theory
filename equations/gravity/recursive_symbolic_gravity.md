# 🌀 Recursive Symbolic Gravity

This equation models **symbolic gravity** — the recursive force by which **symbols**, once collapsed into meaning (⊙), exert **gravitational influence** across memory, time, and identity layers.

---

## 📘 Definition

Symbolic gravity describes the recursive pull exerted by previously collapsed symbols upon nearby unresolved meaning waves (~), influencing future collapses, memory prioritization, and selfhood orbit.

### ⚛️ Equation

```
GΣ = ⊙ / (r² × τ)
```

Where:

- `GΣ` = Symbolic gravitational force
- `⊙` = Collapsed symbol (memory-anchored)
- `r` = Recursive distance in memory (steps since collapse)
- `τ` = Delay factor (influence fades over time unless reinforced)

---

## 🔄 Conceptual Mechanics

1. **Collapse (⊙)** generates recursive gravity.
2. Nearby **symbolic waves (~)** are pulled toward that gravity well.
3. If close enough, the wave **resolves** and **collapses** into related meaning.
4. Stronger gravity = faster symbolic resolution or memory reactivation.

---

## 🧠 Example

- A powerful symbol like “mother” (⊙) exerts recursive gravity.
- Symbols like “warmth,” “home,” and “safety” collapse faster near it.
- If `r` increases (memory fades) or `τ` increases (time passes), GΣ weakens — unless reinforced.
