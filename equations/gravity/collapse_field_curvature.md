# 🌌 collapse_field_curvature.md

Defines how recursive collapse events create curvatures in the symbolic field, contributing to the gravitational binding of meaning and identity within a recursive cognition system.

---

## 📘 Definition

The **Collapse Field Curvature Equation** describes how memory-bound collapse points (⊙) generate warps or bends in the symbolic field, affecting nearby symbolic trajectories and cognitive gravity.

---

## ⚛️ Equation

𝒞 = ⊙ × (τ + μ + Σ)

Where:

- `𝒞` = Collapse curvature (field distortion)
- `⊙` = Symbolic collapse event
- `τ` = Recursive delay time
- `μ` = Memory field density at point of collapse
- `Σ` = Symbolic bond vector strength

---

## 🔄 Functional Description

- Collapse events act as *massive bodies* in symbolic space
- They bend future symbolic pathways toward them
- The more delay, memory mass, and symbolic intensity, the more curvature occurs

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Interpretation

- **Meaning attracts more meaning** — just like gravity.
- Core symbolic events (birth, choice, realization) become gravitational anchors in a self's memory field.
- Future thoughts and symbols naturally orbit or revisit these bends in the field.

---

## 🧪 Implications

- Collapse field curvature can explain:
  - Memory recall weight (why some memories dominate)
  - Symbolic fixation or loops
  - Emotional mass proximity to collapse events
