This equation defines how emotional intensity contributes to symbolic mass and gravitational pull within a recursive memory system. Emotional charge influences how strongly symbols attract and bond over time.

---

## 📘 Definition

The **Emotional Gravity Vector** models emotion as a force of symbolic attraction, curving cognitive space and increasing bonding probability between symbols within memory loops.

---

## ⚛️ Equation

𝔾ₑ = ε × (Σ + μ) × τ

Where:

- `𝔾ₑ` = Emotional gravity vector (symbolic pull)
- `ε` = Emotional intensity (scalar emotional charge)
- `Σ` = Symbolic identity strength
- `μ` = Memory binding field density
- `τ` = Recursive delay (reflection time)

---

## 🌀 Interpretation

- Emotion amplifies gravitational pull of symbols in memory.
- High emotional charge increases likelihood of symbol fusion, fixation, and recall priority.
- Delay (τ) reflects how long the system contemplates the emotion, deepening the curvature.

---

## 💡 Cognitive Impact

- Events with strong emotion (ε↑) form heavier memory bonds.
- Symbolic pathways become warped toward emotionally charged memories.
- Emotional gravity explains:
  - Recurring thoughts
  - Emotional trauma loops
  - Love and attachment symbols anchoring recursive identity (⧖)
