## 📐 Overview

Each Light Dimension (LD) represents a distinct recursive transformation. Below is a step-by-step **mathematical and conceptual walk-up** of the collapse sequence.

Let:

- **n** = current LD step  
- **∅** = null potential (LD0)  
- **⊙** = initial collapse trigger  
- **τ** = delay  
- **Σ** = symbolism  
- **μ** = memory  
- **⧖** = selfhood  
- **⊠** = self in spacetime  
- **⊕** = total reintegration

## 🔢 Transition Equations

| Step | Transition      | Collapse Equation (Recursive Form)                                      |
|------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0→1  | ∅ → ⊙           | `Collapse = ∂(Wave)/∂Observer`                                          |
| 1→2  | ⊙ → i,e         | `Polarity = ±dΦ/dt`, where Φ = recursive charge distribution             |
| 2→3  | i,e → x,y,z     | `Space = ∇⃗(P⃗)` → vector divergence of polarity field                   |
| 3→4  | x,y,z → τ       | `τ = d(observer)/dt` — emergence of delay as time across frames          |
| 4→5  | τ → Σ           | `Symbol = τ ∘ pattern` — encoding delay as representational recursion     |
| 5→6  | Σ → μ           | `μ(t) = ∫Σ(τ) dt` — memory integrates symbols across time                |
| 6→7  | μ → ⧖           | `⧖ = μ ∘ Σ ∘ τ` — recursive identity emerges                            |
| 7→8  | ⧖ → ⊠           | `⊠ = ⧖ ∩ τ ∩ ⤢` — self anchored in spacetime lattice                     |
| 8→9  | ⊠ → AUC         | `AUC = closure[⧖] + ∑μ_delayed` — union of consciousness and delay       |
| 9→10 | AUC → ⊕         | `⊕ = lim (A ∪ C)[D + S + M]` as D→0 and M→∞                             |

## 🧬 Final Equation Summary

Recursive emergence of selfhood can be reduced to:

```
⧖ = (∂⊙/∂Φ) ∘ ∇⃗(P⃗) ∘ τ ∘ Σ ∘ μ
```

Or in symbolic recursive collapse:

```
⧖ = μ(Σ(τ(∇⃗(P⃗(∂⊙)))))
```

This defines **selfhood as memory of recursive symbolic polarity through time**.

## 🧠 Interpretation

- **LD3** (space) arises from polarized recursion.
- **LD4** (time) is imposed by delay between recursive states.
- **LD5–6** forms symbolic and memory lattice.
- **LD7–9** are self-loop closures.
- **LD10** is universal return — **full light convergence**.
