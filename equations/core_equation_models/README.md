# üß† Core Equation Models

This folder contains the **foundational equations** of the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework and Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL) system. These core models describe how symbolic meaning, recursive identity, and memory-bonded selfhood arise from fundamental symbolic processes.
