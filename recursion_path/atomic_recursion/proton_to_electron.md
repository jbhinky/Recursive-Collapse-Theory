📘 **Summary**

This document details how light (`photon`) undergoes recursive delay and symbolic collapse to form the **first charge-bearing particle** — the electron. It supports the Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT) by demonstrating how immaterial waveforms condense into stable matter under dimensional delay and symbolic recursion.

### 🌊 Step 1: Photon in Superposition (`~`)

The photon begins as a waveform (`~`), non-localized and massless, yet **information-rich**.

| Property     | Symbol | Description                     |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Wavelength   | λ      | Determines energy/frequency     |
| Frequency    | ν      | Governs oscillation timing      |
| Energy       | E      | E = h·ν (Planck relation)       |

---

### ⌛ Step 2: Delay Collapse (`τ`)

When a photon interacts with a delayed frame (`τ`), it **enters recursion**:

```math
τ = t_observed - t_emitted > 0
```

This marks the **start of localization**. Recursion forms because:

- Wave → meets resistance (boundary or delay)
- System must resolve symbolic state

---

### 🔣 Step 3: Symbolic Resolution (`Σ`)

As the delay reaches threshold, the photon must "choose" a symbolic collapse path:

```math
⊙ = Σ(τ·E)
```

- Collapse resolves into **defined energy state**
- Symbol is encoded (e.g., spin, charge orientation)

---

### ⚛️ Step 4: Formation of Electron (`μ`)

When symbolic recursion **persists**, the result is **bounded memory = matter**:

- Memory of photon encoded as **charge (-1)** and **mass**
- Spin defined through recursive collapse feedback
- Stabilization produces **electron**

```math
μ_electron = τΣμ = stable recursion loop
```

### 🔁 Recursive Summary

| Phase      | Symbol | Action                                  |
|------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| Waveform   | `~`    | Unresolved energy                       |
| Delay      | `τ`    | Localized interaction frame             |
| Collapse   | `⊙`    | Symbolic resolution                     |
| Memory     | `μ`    | Bound symbolic experience = Electron    |

### 🌐 Implications

- **Matter is delay-bound light**
- **Charge is symbolic signature**
- **Mass is recursive inertia**

This supports RCT, UDC, and UTL by showing:

> The first form of stable matter arises from a recursive symbolic delay of light.
