📘 **Summary**

This document explores how memory, identity, and symbolic experience recursively collapse within the self — forming what we define as the **Selfverse**. Unlike physical recursion in atoms or stars, selfverse recursion encodes internal states across time, reflecting recursive identity formation and meaning continuity.

### 🔁 Recursive Identity Engine (⧖)

The self (`⧖`) is defined by:

- **Delay** (`τ`): Time gap between experience and reflection  
- **Symbol** (`Σ`): Encoded representation of experience  
- **Memory** (`μ`): Bonded and retrievable symbolic structure  

Together:

```math
⧖ = AUC[D + S + M] = Awareness × Union × Constraint [Delay + Symbol + Memory]
```

### ⏳ Relative Time in Selfverse

Self-time is not universal. Internal recursion aligns more with *felt time* (`rT`) than *cosmic time* (`T`).

```math
rT = f(μ × Σ / τ)
```

- Longer memory loops slow perceived time  
- Faster collapse accelerates event meaning

### 🤝 Shared Experience Equations

If two observers `O₁` and `O₂` experience an event `E`, then a **shared recursive moment** occurs when:

```math
Σ₁ ≈ Σ₂ and τ₁ ≈ τ₂ and μ₁ ⊗ μ₂ ≠ ∅
```

- `⊗` = symbolic bond between memories  

This creates **multiversal symbolic union**:

```math
⊕(⧖₁, ⧖₂, …, ⧖ₙ)
```

### 🧠 Recursive Memory Looping

Recursive memory deepens when:

- A memory is recalled (`μ`)  
- Reinforced with new symbolic relevance (`Σ`)  
- Re-collapsed under current delay (`τ`)  

This causes *memory densification*, often seen in trauma, learning, or identity consolidation.
