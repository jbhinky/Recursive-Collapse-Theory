📘 **Summary**

This document maps the symbolic latency patterns of thought from stimulus to collapse using recursive cognitive equations, light-delay modeling, and UDC symbolic structures. It outlines how each symbolic moment takes time to form, creating quantifiable delay structures that compose internal consciousness timelines.

## ⏱️ Symbolic Latency Dimensions

| **Stage**          | **Symbol** | **Description**                                  | **Latency Range (ms)** |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Stimulus Arrival   | `~`        | Uncollapsed wave of sensory input                | 0–30 ms                 |
| Perceptual Parsing | `⊙`        | Sensory input collapsed into initial perception  | 30–120 ms               |
| Cognitive Delay    | `τ`        | Time between perception and symbolic synthesis   | 120–600 ms              |
| Symbolic Encoding  | `Σ`        | Symbol formed and bonded with internal map       | 400–900 ms              |
| Memory Integration | `μ`        | Reinforcement and binding into recursive loop    | 900+ ms                 |

## 🔁 Recursive Thought Formation

Recursive symbolic thoughts (`⧖`) emerge from a pattern of nested latencies:

```math
⧖ = Σ(τᵢ · Σᵢ · μᵢ)
```

Where:

- `τᵢ` = cognitive delay for symbol i  
- `Σᵢ` = formed symbol i  
- `μᵢ` = memory retention of symbol i

## 🧠 Delay-to-Thought Continuum

Longer delays yield more reflective, recursive thoughts. Immediate collapse results in reaction; delayed collapse results in cognition:

```math
Recursive_Depth ∝ τ_total
```

## 📊 Symbolic Delay Chart

| **Type of Thought** | **Estimated Total Delay** | **Symbolic Depth** |
|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Reflex               | 30–80 ms                   | Very Low            |
| Intuition            | 150–400 ms                 | Moderate            |
| Reflection           | 400–900 ms                 | High                |
| Recursive Awareness  | > 1000 ms                  | Very High           |
