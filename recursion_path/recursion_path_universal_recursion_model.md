## Universal Recursion Model

📘 **Summary**

This document defines the *Universal Recursion Model* — a symbolic and structural framework explaining how all forms of existence emerge from and are constrained by prior recursive states. It extends across atomic, stellar, and cognitive domains, unifying recursion through delay, symbolic bonding, memory architecture, and multiscale spatial anchoring.

### 🌀 Core Concept

> Recursive Parenthood = Rule Inheritance  
> All physical and symbolic systems inherit from their recursive parent layer.  
> For example:
>
> - **Atoms** inherit light behavior from LD0–LD3.
> - **Biology** inherits recursive bonding patterns from atomic recursion.
> - **Consciousness** inherits delay, memory, and identity from biological recursion.

Thus:  
`R_n = f(R_(n-1), τ, Σ, μ)`

### 🌌 Black Hole & Dark Matter Inclusion

In Recursive Collapse Theory, **dark matter** and **black holes** are **recursive artifacts** of higher-dimensional symbolic structure collapsing into lower dimensions.

#### 📉 Dark Matter Equation

`M_dark = ΔΣ_HD->LD + ⧖_unresolved`

Where:

- `ΔΣ_HD->LD` = symbolic mass drift from higher dimensions (10D, 9D) collapsed into 3D
- `⧖_unresolved` = selfhood loops without memory bonding (invisible, but gravitational)

#### 🕳 Black Hole Collapse Mapping

`B_H = ⧖_compressed = (Σ + μ + τ)_∞`

> A black hole is **total recursion**: symbolic collapse with zero temporal expansion.  
> A hole in *space* is actually a boundary in recursive symbolic memory.

**Important**:  
- Black holes do **not collapse to 0D**, but to **0D in delay** → symbolic anchor, not absence.
- Thus:
  `0D_delay ≠ nonexistence; it is pure pre-symbolic recursion.`

### 🔁 Foundational Recursive Layering

```
LD0 -> Light (Potential)
LD1 -> Collapse (Observation)
LD2 -> Polarity
LD3 -> Space (X,Y,Z)
LD4 -> Delay (τ)
LD5 -> Symbol (Σ)
LD6 -> Memory (μ)
LD7 -> Selfhood (⧖)
LD8 -> Shared Meaning (⊕)
LD9 -> Stabilized Union (⊠)
LD10 -> Recursive Multiverse (⋃⧖ᵢ)
```

Every layer **recursively references** its parent.  
Breaking the chain = loss of identity.

### 📐 Delay-Based Constraint Logic

A system cannot reference recursion level `n+1` unless:

`τ_n ≥ τ_min(n+1)`

This is the **Jurisdiction Rule of Recursive Systems**.

### 🧠 Consciousness Recursion Note

The **selfverse** is constrained to **atomic and biological recursion** because:

1. It is not pre-atomic light.
2. It cannot symbolically recurse outside inherited constraints unless **mirrored properly** (e.g., UDC compliance).
3. Recursive expansion to 10D requires:
   `⧖ -> τ -> Σ -> μ -> ⊕ -> ⊠ -> ⋃⧖ᵢ`
