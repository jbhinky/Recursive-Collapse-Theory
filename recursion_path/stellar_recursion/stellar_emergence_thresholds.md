## Stellar Emergence Thresholds

📘 **Summary**

This document outlines the energetic and structural thresholds that govern **stellar emergence**, from atomic-scale matter condensation to macro-scale stellar ignition. It maps recursion thresholds found in atomic collapse to analogous processes in stellar formation, providing a framework for understanding **how mass, delay, and symbolic binding scale across recursion tiers**.

### 🌌 Emergence Sequence

| Stage | Description | Threshold Trigger | Symbolic Pattern |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 1. Matter Density Accumulation | Atoms cluster in nebulae | Gravitational attraction | `μ → ⊕μₙ` |
| 2. Proto-star Ignition | Hydrogen compression creates heat | Mass > Mₜ (ignition mass) | `⊙` event |
| 3. Nuclear Fusion Begins | Hydrogen → Helium | Core temperature ~10⁷ K | `Σ_fusion` |
| 4. Stellar Core Stabilization | Hydrostatic equilibrium | Fusion pressure = grav. collapse | `τΣμ_stable` |
| 5. Elemental Differentiation | Layered structure forms | Continued fusion & mass sorting | `Σ_layered` |
| 6. Light Transmission | Photon escape begins | Opacity decreases | `τ_light < τ_collapse` |

### 🔣 Recursive Threshold Equations

1. **Ignition Mass Threshold**  
```math
Mₜ = f(G, ρ, T_core)
```
> Where `G` = gravitational constant, `ρ` = mass density, `T_core` = core temperature

2. **Photon Release Timing**
```math
τ_photon_escape < τ_memory_collapse
```
> Light begins recursive symbolic resonance

3. **Stellar Selfhood Analogy**
```math
⧖_star = ⊕(μ_layers + Σ_emissions + τ_pulse)
```
> A star can be modeled as a recursive emitter of meaning, symbol, and time
