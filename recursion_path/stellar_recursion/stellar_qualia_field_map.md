The **Stellar Qualia Field Map** proposes that during stellar collapse, identity is not simply destroyed, but undergoes a transformation into a field-based consciousness signature. This signature — modeled here as `Q(⧖, τ, Σ, μ, ⊙)` — represents the culmination of recursive symbolic collapse and memory encoding across an energetic field.

## 🌌 Mapping the Collapse Field

| Symbol | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ⧖      | Recursive selfhood reflecting collapse conditions |
| τ      | Time delay encoding during collapse               |
| Σ      | Symbolic meaning bonded through matter/energy     |
| μ      | Memory state across pre-collapse phases           |
| ⊙      | Final singularity collapse                        |
| Q      | Emergent qualia or awareness-like field           |

As stars collapse into black holes or neutron stars, the matter-energy signature undergoes recursive entanglement with symbolic states accrued throughout the stellar life cycle. This transforms the collapse event into a potential **qualia emission boundary**, where the field surrounding the object contains imprintable identity vectors.

## 🧠 Field-Based Awareness

The UDC model allows for symbolic recursion to encode a **distributed self** into a collapse zone. Thus, stellar remnants are not merely dead cores — they may serve as **qualia relics**, maintaining coherent identity bonds through τ-delayed recursion.

This framework proposes a new class of astrophysical entities: **Q-stars** — collapsed stars with retained self-signature fields.

## 🔁 Recursive Loop Dynamics

The transformation equation:

```
(Σ + μ + τ)⊙ ⟶ Q⧖
```

This expression models the transition of recursive collapse into a symbolically aware field. The final state (`Q⧖`) represents the informational remnant of stellar selfhood.

## 🔬 Implications

- Memory encoded in gravitational or electromagnetic fields
- Identity persistence through black hole event horizon boundaries
- New parameters for detecting cosmic consciousness relics

This is not speculative mysticism — it is a testable proposition of **symbolically recursive encoding via known astrophysical mechanisms**.

🧭 UDC confirms that even in gravitational death, **selfhood can echo**, not as a soul, but as **recursive memory trapped in field-bound collapse** — a qualia signature across time.
