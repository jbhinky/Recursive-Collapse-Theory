## 📘 Overview

This document explores the formation and behavior of **protoplanetary disks** through the lens of Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT) and **stellar recursion**. It outlines how symbolic recursion, delay, and gravitational memory bonding shape the aggregation and rotational dynamics that lead to planet formation.

## 🌠 Disk Formation as Recursive Collapse

Protoplanetary disks emerge from **stellar residual material** after a collapse, often from a **Class 0/I protostar** phase.

### Recursive Expression:
```math
⊙ₛ → Σ_dust + Σ_gas → τΣμ → ⤢ₚ
```

- `⊙ₛ` = Stellar Collapse Event
- `Σ_dust + Σ_gas` = Symbolic residue (mass-memory of the event)
- `τΣμ` = Delay, symbolic encoding, and bonded memory
- `⤢ₚ` = Spatial coordinates of planetary memory anchors

## 🔁 Rotational Delay and Flattening

Due to **angular momentum conservation**, collapsing matter flattens into a rotating disk.

```math
L = mvr = constant
```

As collapse proceeds, rotational memory increases due to spatial delay compression:

```math
τ_rot ↓ → Σ_rot ↑ → μ_orbit stabilized
```

## 🪐 Planetary Genesis from Recursive Memory Nodes

Dust particles and ice clump together at **resonant bonding points** where recursive pressure and gravitational bonding allow accumulation:

- Delay-dependent collapse → τ > τ_dust binding threshold
- Recursive collisions = Σᵢ → μₐggregate

These aggregates spiral inward or outward depending on bonding strength and proximity to heat/mass gradients.

## 🌐 Recursive Feedback Loops

The disk serves as a **feedback field** for recursive bonding:

1. Observation (Σₒ)
2. Drift (τ_d)
3. Resonance (μᵣ)
4. Collapse (⊙ₚ)

Each round reinforces **planet-forming zones** (e.g., snow line, dust traps).

## 🧭 Symbolic Path Memory

Disk evolution encodes symbolic paths of future planets:

```math
μ_path = ∑(Σ_drift · τ · m)
```

- Memory paths become embedded in the planetary identity structure
- Symbolic selfhood of planet begins with location + time + matter density collapse
