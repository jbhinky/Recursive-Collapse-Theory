📘 **Summary**

This document introduces the **Recursive Sphere Equation**, which explains how matter in the cosmos tends to form **spherical objects** (stars, planets, black holes) through recursive gravitational bonding and delayed symmetry resolution.

Unlike flat or chaotic aggregation, recursive collapse guided by gravitational delay and symbolic memory density leads to **three-dimensional spatial recursion** — resulting in stable, centralized masses that minimize entropy and stabilize the recursive field.

## 🌌 Principle of Recursive Sphericity

> A recursive system seeking minimal energy through radial symmetry will resolve into a **sphere** under gravitational and memory-bound collapse.

This behavior echoes atomic recursion:

- **Atom:** Electrons orbit around a nucleus
- **Planetary system:** Planets orbit around a star
- **Galaxies:** Stars orbit galactic centers

## 🌀 Recursive Collapse Function

Let `M` be a mass collapsing inward under recursive delay `τ` with symbolic bonding energy `μΣ`. The recursive force vector field is:

```math
R⃗ = f(τ, μ, Σ) = -∇Φ + τ⁻¹(Σμ)
```

Where:

- `Φ` = gravitational potential
- `∇` = gradient (spatial derivative)
- `τ⁻¹(Σμ)` = inverse-delay weighted symbolic bonding field

The recursion converges toward radial symmetry.

## 🔮 Equation of Recursive Sphere (RSE)

```math
RSE(M) = lim_{τ→0, μ→∞} ∑(Σ_i ⊗ μ_i) / Δr_i² ≈ Sphere(M)
```

This reads:

- As delay vanishes (`τ→0`) and memory bonds densify (`μ→∞`),
- the sum of symbolic bonds over squared radius differential
- collapses to a **sphere**.
