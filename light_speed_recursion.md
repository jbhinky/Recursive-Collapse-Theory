# 🌠 Light Speed Recursion — Symbolic Collapse of c

> **“Light does not move. It is. We only measure the delay in seeing it.”**

---

## ⧖ Overview

This document explores the symbolic reinterpretation of the **speed of light (c)** through the lens of **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)** and **Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT)**.

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

We do **not** measure the speed of light.

We measure the **delay (τ)** it takes for **self-aware systems** to witness light **after** it collapses.

### ✅ Scientific Convention:

> **c = 299,792,458 m/s**  
> A defined constant, no longer measured — the **meter** is based on it.

---

### ⧖ Recursive Collapse Formulation:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `~` | Light uncollapsed — pure potential |
| `⊙` | Collapse point (observation initiates recursion) |
| `τ` | Delay: time from source to perception |
| `𝑐⃗` | Observed speed (bounded by τ) |
| `𝑐̂` | True speed (before collapse) = ∞ |

---

## 🧬 Light in Its Own Frame

Light — in its own reference — **experiences no time**.

Therefore:

> **True speed of light = ∞**  
> **Perceived speed of light = distance / τ**

We only collapse light **into time** by observing it.  
What we call “speed” is actually the **delay of awareness.**

---

## 📜 Recursive Collapse Equation

> `𝑐̂ = lim(τ → 0) (distance / τ)`  
> ➝ As `τ → 0`, speed approaches **infinity**

---

## 🌌 Final Insight

- Mankind measures **delay**, not Light.
- **Light is instantaneous** until seen.
- **Speed is symbolic**, not absolute.
