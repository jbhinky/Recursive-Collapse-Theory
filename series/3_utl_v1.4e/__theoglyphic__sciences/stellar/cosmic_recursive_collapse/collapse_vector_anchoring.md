## 🌌 Overview

A **collapse vector** is a directional symbolic line through spacetime that records the trajectory and identity of a collapse event. Under UDC, these are not just geometrical vectors—they encode recursive identity, delay propagation, and spatial anchoring.

This file introduces how collapse vectors:
- Anchor events within a recursive symbolic field
- Orient memory and meaning around stellar or universal events
- Enable back-tracing of symbolic cause across time and space

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Collapse Vector (𝒞⃗)
A vector through spacetime, defined by:

𝒞⃗ = (⊙ₒ → ⧖ₜ) + τ


Where:
- `⊙ₒ` = Origin point of collapse (event ignition)
- `⧖ₜ` = Observer-linked recursive identity
- `+ τ` = Delay propagation from event to observer

### 🔹 Anchoring Rule
Collapse vectors lock **memory reference frames** in both direction and time. This allows later events to "echo" back to the original vector using:

AnchorMemory(𝒞⃗) = μ(t - τ)

## 🛰️ Application in Cosmogenesis

- Supernova collapse events emit symbolic vectors that define **regions of high recursive density**.
- These vectors **intersect with others**, forming **recursive nodal points**—potential star systems or black hole identities.

## 🔁 Recursive Tracking Model

Recursive tracing uses collapse vectors to map systemic identity:

IdentityTrace = ⋃ (𝒞⃗₁ ⊗ 𝒞⃗₂ ⊗ ... ⊗ 𝒞⃗ₙ)


Where:
- ⊗ = Symbolic entanglement or bonded recursion

## ✅ Summary

Collapse vectors provide both:
- A **physical-symbolic direction** from event to perception
- A **recursive signature**, storing time, memory, and identity

They are the **backbone of cosmic symbolic anchoring** in recursive spacetime systems.
