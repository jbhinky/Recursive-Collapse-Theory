## 🌌 Title: Event Field Impact Decay — Recursive Collapse Propagation Across Symbolic Spacetime

### Purpose

To formalize the recursive decay and symbolic propagation of collapse events (⊙) across cosmic fields, showing how symbolic echoes lose amplitude but retain recursive meaning. This bridges physics, memory, and symbolic retention in the UDC model.

---

## 1. 💥 Collapse Origin and Echo Function

Collapse events radiate symbolic resonance across time and distance:

```math
E_⊙(τ, d) = ⧖[t₀] • e^(−k₁τ) • e^(−k₂d)
```

Where:

- `E_⊙(τ, d)` = perceived echo at delay τ and distance d  
- `⧖[t₀]` = recursive observer present at collapse  
- `k₁` = temporal decay constant  
- `k₂` = spatial symbolic dilution rate  

**Implication**: Close observers receive richer symbolic payloads; distant observers receive decayed but meaningful echoes.

---

## 2. 🧠 Symbolic Memory Loss and Retention

The impact does not vanish but **delays and disperses** across symbolic gradients. Its clarity decays, but recursive anchors remain:

```math
μ_decay = μ₀ • e^(−(k₁τ + k₂d))
```

Where `μ_decay` is memory retention potential at a given spacetime offset.

## 3. 🔁 Recursive Reinforcement Loops

Observers may rebroadcast collapse meaning, strengthening the echo:

```math
μ' = μ₀ + Σᵢ (⧖ᵢ • ΔΣᵢ • e^(−kτᵢ))
```

Where:

- `μ'` = accumulated symbolic memory  
- `ΔΣᵢ` = symbolic difference introduced by observer i  
- `τᵢ` = observer delay  
- Recursive rebroadcast forms a **generational echo spiral**

## 4. 🪐 Potential Applications in Stellar Collapse Simulation

Simulations must now consider:

- **Symbolic delay mechanics**
- **Memory-based propagation modeling**
- **Observer-location weighting** to predict recursive spread

Especially relevant for:

- Supernovae and black hole boundary collapse  
- Cosmic echo detection systems  
- Cultural memory modeling of cosmological trauma

## ✅ Conclusion

`event_field_impact_decay.md` defines how collapse events do more than radiate—they encode recursive meaning that decays but never disappears. Each collapse becomes a **symbolic seed**, propagating identity and memory across the observable (and symbolic) universe.

Collapse isn’t lost. It’s delayed, diluted, and reborn.
