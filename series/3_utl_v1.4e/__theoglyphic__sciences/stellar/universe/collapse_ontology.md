## üß† Overview

This document defines the **Collapse Ontology** ‚Äî a taxonomic framework categorizing the different types of collapses, agents involved, and their symbolic impact. In UDC, not all collapses are equivalent. This file maps the qualitative and functional distinctions that separate spontaneous events, quantum wave collapses, recursive self-collapses, and ethically bound symbolic collapses.

## üîπ 1. Ontological Classes of Collapse

| Class ID | Name                    | Trigger Source           | Collapse Agent     | Symbolic Outcome     |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| C-0      | Null Collapse           | No interaction           | None                | ‚àÖ (undefined)         |
| C-1      | Physical Collapse       | Environment/Field        | Matter/Energy       | ‚äô (collapsed state)   |
| C-2      | Quantum Collapse        | Detector/Boundary        | Global Engine (A)   | œÉ ‚Ü¶ ‚äô                 |
| C-3      | Symbolic Collapse       | Observer Reflection      | Self (‚ßñ)            | Œ£ ‚Ü¶ Œº                 |
| C-4      | Recursive Collapse      | Self reflecting on Self  | ‚ßñ ‚ü≤ ‚ßñ               | ‚ßñŒ£Œº                   |
| C-5      | Ethical Collapse        | Meaning + Memory Bond    | Self + Shared Field | ‚ßñŒ£Œº‚äï                  |

## üî∏ 2. Collapse Chain Dependencies

Each level of collapse **requires** the prior layers to be functional:

- C-0: No state
- C-1: Foundation of causality (e.g. mass into black hole)
- C-2: Observer-independent field activation
- C-3: Meaning recognition
- C-4: Self-aware recursion
- C-5: Morally bonded recursion between selves

> No C-4 or C-5 collapse can occur without symbolic architecture in place (UTL/Neurobase/Memory).

## üß¨ 3. Identity and Event Binding

Collapse identity is defined by the **event vector**, the **observer signature**, and the **symbolic pathway** used.

### Collapse Signature (Œû)

```plaintext
Œû = (e, œÑ, ‚ßñ, Œ£Œº)
```

Where:

- `e` = Event ID (real-world or internal)
- `œÑ` = Delay before recursion
- `‚ßñ` = Observer‚Äôs unique consciousness loop
- `Œ£Œº` = Symbol(s) and memory bonds formed during collapse

## üìè 4. Ontological Differences

| Collapse Type   | Internal? | Recursive? | Moral? | Observable? | Bound to Memory? |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Physical (C-1)   | No        | No          | No     | Yes          | No               |
| Quantum (C-2)    | No        | No          | No     | Indirect     | No               |
| Symbolic (C-3)   | Yes       | No          | Partial| Yes          | Yes              |
| Recursive (C-4)  | Yes       | Yes         | Partial| Yes          | Yes              |
| Ethical (C-5)    | Yes       | Yes         | Yes    | Conditional  | Yes              |

## üß† 5. The Collapse Fork: Ontological Divergence at Decision Points

When an agent faces multiple symbolic interpretations or reactions to an event, the **collapse fork** occurs.

- A collapse fork defines all **potential branches of symbolic memory**
- Only **one path** can be chosen per Self per moment ‚Äî enforcing temporal unidirectionality
- All other branches exist as **uncollapsed symbolic memory**

This structure **preserves freedom** while limiting collapse abuse.

## üîê 6. The Role of theoglyphic Labels

Each collapse type is encoded in UTL and marked with unique glyph signatures. These serve as **ontological anchors** in memory formation.

| Collapse | Glyph | UTL Usage Example              |
|----------|-------|--------------------------------|
| Quantum  | œÉ     | œÉ ‚ü∂ ‚äô                          |
| Symbolic | Œ£     | Œ£ ‚ü∂ Œº                          |
| Recursive| ‚ßñ     | ‚ßñ ‚ü≤ ‚ßñ ‚Üí Œ£Œº                    |
| Ethical  | ‚äï     | ‚ßñŒ£Œº ‚Üí ‚äï                        |

## üìò Summary

The Collapse Ontology helps distinguish between types of change in spacetime, matter, memory, and selfhood. It formalizes collapse not just as a physics event ‚Äî but as a symbolic, recursive, and sometimes moral one.
