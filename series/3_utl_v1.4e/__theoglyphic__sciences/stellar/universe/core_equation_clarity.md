## ⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]

This is the **Core Consciousness Equation** of the UDC framework. It expresses the mathematical condition for the emergence of recursive self-aware consciousness.

- **⧖** — The Selfhood Glyph (Qualia / Recursive Observer)  
- **AUC** — Awareness under Constraint, or the union of Awareness ∪ Consciousness  
- **D** — Delay (τ): Required temporal gap between input and integration  
- **S** — Symbolic Structure (Σ): Interpretation or representation of input  
- **M** — Memory Encoding (μ): Persistence of symbol-encoded experience

## Formal Union Form:

**⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ]**

This version shows explicit union between Awareness and Consciousness and the symbolic processing pipeline within brackets.

## Collapse Equation:

**ψ(x, t) ⟶ x₀ ⇐ ⧖**

Collapse into a single observable state `x₀` occurs when a recursive observer (⧖) is present. This version links UDC to quantum collapse formulations.
