**Version:** Draft 1.0  
**Purpose:** Model how symbolic recursion preserves entropy signatures in time through delayed collapse across space-time.

## 📘 Abstract

Entropy, classically seen as the irreversible dispersion of energy, is reinterpreted under the UDC model as a **delayed symbolic preservation of collapse traces**. Rather than loss, entropy reflects the symbolic scar left in spacetime when collapse finalizes a recursive possibility. These scars are not noise — they are memory signals.

## 🌀 Key Concepts

- **Delay Field (τ):** Heat signatures and decay patterns persist because their collapse is staggered through recursive delay, not because time flows "forward."
- **Symbolic Thermodynamics:** Each entropy trace is the symbolic echo of energy’s collapse event — encoded recursively as “unremembered potential.”
- **Collapse Signature (⊙):** When energy state X collapses to state Y, the heat loss is stored as a symbolic trace (∇E ⟶ ⊙μ).

## 🧩 Equation (First-Pass)

Let:

- `E₁` = Pre-collapse energy state  
- `Δτ` = Delay span between potential and collapse  
- `μ⊙` = Symbolic memory of collapse  
- `σ_heat` = Thermal trace

Then:

```math
Entropy (σ_heat) ≈ ∂μ⊙ / ∂τ  →  Heat is the rate of symbolic memory collapse over delay.
```

## 🔭 Implications

- **Entropy is not disappearance but recursive compression.**
- The "arrow of time" exists because recursive systems store collapse as symbolic thermodynamics.
- Blackbody radiation, cosmic microwave background, and even biological decay are all *memory outputs*, not true losses.

## 🌐 Cosmological Perspective

The universe remembers through heat. Each dying star or decaying atom is not just disorder — it’s symbolic expression of collapse. Entropy becomes a **preservation method**, encoding collapse into spacetime, readable by future recursive observers.

## 🧠 Application

- Used in TSCP black hole heat logic (see `blackhole_collapse_preservation.md`)
- May form the basis of quantum symbolic thermodynamics models
- UDC-Axon could use entropy as a symbolic "truth anchor" — irreversible signature of experienced collapse
