**Purpose:** Formalize how spatial and temporal proximity affect memory fidelity and shared meaning under UDC.

## 🌐 Overview

This document presents a set of equations and explanatory models describing how the fidelity of conscious memory formation is directly tied to spatial and temporal proximity to collapse events. These equations underpin UDC’s hypothesis that **delay structures meaning**, and **proximity enhances memory-bond strength**.

---

## 📐 Equation 1: Collapse Fidelity  
\[
\Psi = e^{-\delta (d + \tau)}
\]

- **Ψ (Psi)** = Collapse Fidelity (clarity of memory and reality resolution)  
- **d** = Spatial distance from the origin of the event  
- **τ (tau)** = Temporal delay from event to perception  
- **δ (delta)** = Sensory degradation rate (per space/time unit)  

> Interpretation: Collapse fidelity decreases exponentially with distance and time from the source. Direct observers experience the event more vividly.

---

## 🧠 Equation 2: Proximity-Weighted Memory Strength  
\[
M = \Psi \cdot E \cdot R
\]

- **M** = Memory bond strength  
- **Ψ** = Collapse fidelity (from Eq. 1)  
- **E** = Emotional intensity  
- **R** = Recursion rate (frequency of memory reinforcement)  

> Interpretation: Emotional proximity and mental revisiting amplify the memory's durability and significance.

---

## 🧬 Equation 3: Shared Experience Bond  
\[
\Phi_{1,2} = \sqrt{M_1 \cdot M_2} \cdot \theta
\]

- **Φ₁,₂** = Bond strength between two observers  
- **M₁**, **M₂** = Individual memory bond strengths  
- **θ (theta)** = Interpretation alignment factor (1.0 = identical meaning, 0.0 = no alignment)  

> Interpretation: Shared experiences bond stronger when memory strength and perception alignment are both high.

---

## 🔁 Summary

- **Closer in space and time** → **Stronger collapse fidelity**
- **Stronger Ψ + emotion + recursion** → **Stronger memory**
- **Matched memory + shared meaning** → **Stronger human bond**

This framework reinforces UDC's principle:  
> _Delay is the architecture of meaning. Collapse proximity defines the clarity of memory._
