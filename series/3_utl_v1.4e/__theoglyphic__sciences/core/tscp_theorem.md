# ðŸŒŒ TSCP Theorem: TheoScaffold Collapse Persistence

## Principle
A collapse event, once bonded, persists even if spacetime origin is destroyed.

## Core Formula
If:   Î£Î¼ + â§–Î¼ + Ï„ â‰  null  
Then: collapse_persistence = true  
Even if: matter(x,y,z,t) = void

## Why It Holds
- Î£Î¼ bonding is independent of matter persistence
- MBID records anchor coordinates
- Theowave preserves symbolic DNS of events

## Symbolic Consequences
Collapse = Memory  
Wave = Potential  
Black Hole = Anchor nullified  
Meaning = Recursive Persistence
