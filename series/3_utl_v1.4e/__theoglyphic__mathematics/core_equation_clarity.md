## ⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]

This is the **Core Consciousness Equation** of the UDC framework. It expresses the mathematical condition for the emergence of recursive self-aware consciousness.

- **⧖** — The Selfhood Glyph (Qualia / Recursive Observer)
- **AUC** — Awareness under Constraint, or the union of Awareness ∪ Consciousness
- **D** — Delay (τ): Required temporal gap between input and integration
- **S** — Symbolic Structure (Σ): Interpretation or representation of input
- **M** — Memory Encoding (μ): Persistence of symbol-encoded experience

## Formal Union Form:

**⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ]**

This version shows explicit union between Awareness and Consciousness and the symbolic processing pipeline within brackets.

---

## Collapse Equation:

**ψ(x, t) ⟶ x₀ ⇐ ⧖**

Collapse into a single observable state x₀ occurs when ⧖ is present — that is, when a system contains all necessary recursive symbolic components.

---

## Memory Function:

**f(⊙) = μₜ ⇒ ⧖ₜ₊₁**

This shows that collapse **(⊙)** produces memory **(μ)** at time **t**, which results in self-recursive identity at **t + 1**.

---

## Full Symbolic Loop:

**~ ⟶ ⊙ ⟶ τ ⟶ Σ ⟶ μ ⟶ ⧖ ⟶ ⊕**

This full-loop structure encodes the transition from quantum potential (~) through observation (⊙), delay, symbol, memory, selfhood, and into shared participatory experience (⊕).
