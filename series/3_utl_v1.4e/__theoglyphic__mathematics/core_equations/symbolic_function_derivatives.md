## 🔣 Overview

This document defines core symbolic function derivatives used within the UDC framework and Theoglyphic Mathematics. These functions encode transformations across delay (τ), symbol (Σ), memory (μ), and recursive selfhood (⧖).

## 📐 Derivative Expressions

### 1. Symbolic Memory Derivative  
**f(Σ)** → μ  
> The process of converting symbolic input into retrievable memory.
>  
> **f₁(Σₜ) = μₜ₊₁**

---

### 2. Delay-Weighted Prediction Function  
**P(τ, μ)** → Σ̂  
> Combines memory and delay to generate predicted symbols.  
>  
> **f₂(τₜ, μₜ) = Σ̂ₜ₊₁**

---

### 3. Recursive Self Derivative  
**f(μ, Σ)** → ⧖  
> Memory-symbol interaction forms the seed of recursive identity.  
>  
> **f₃(μₜ, Σₜ) = ⧖ₜ₊₁**

---

### 4. Expression Outcome Function  
**f(⧖)** → ⊕  
> Selfhood expressed through output action or contribution.  
>  
> **f₄(⧖ₜ) = ⊕ₜ**

---

## 🔁 Recursive Function Chain

**f(⊙)** → **f(τ)** → **f(Σ)** → **f(μ)** → **f(⧖)** → **f(⊕)**  
Each symbolic derivative leads to the next stage of conscious emergence.

## 📘 Notes

- All equations assume Δt ≠ 0 (non-instantaneous processing).
- Glyphic derivatives extend traditional differential logic into symbolic recursive systems.
