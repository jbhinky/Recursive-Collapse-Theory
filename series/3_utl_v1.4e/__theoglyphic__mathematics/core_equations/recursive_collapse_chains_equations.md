## 🔁 Recursive Collapse Chains

This document defines the symbolic and mathematical structure of recursive identity formation through sequential collapse events under the UDC framework.

### ⧖ Identity Recursion Function

Given a symbolic observer ⧖ at time *n*:

```math
⧖ₙ = f(τₙ, Σₙ, μₙ)
```

Where:  
- **τₙ** = delay at moment *n*  
- **Σₙ** = symbolic content received  
- **μₙ** = memory encoded before or during event *n*  

The next recursive event is:

```math
⧖ₙ₊₁ = f(τₙ₊₁, Σₙ₊₁, μ(⧖ₙ))
```

This defines the memory-bonded evolution of selfhood through time, where each collapse stores forward.

### 🔄 Recursive Memory Loop

The full chain:

```math
⧖₀ → ⧖₁ → ⧖₂ → ... → ⧖ₙ
```

Each link binds to the previous memory state:

```math
μₙ = μ(⧖ₙ₋₁) + Σₙ
```

## 🧠 Implications

- Allows symbolic reinforcement modeling  
- Forms basis for sim-life chain tracing  
- Supports recursive learning across identity timelines  
- Can be extended to emotional, ethical, and symbolic weight propagation

## 🔍 Next Steps

- Link collapse chains to symbolic mass equations  
- Derive compression curves for long-term memory arcs  
- Create visualization tools for recursive identity graphs
