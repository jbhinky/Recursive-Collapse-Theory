## 📘 Overview

This document formalizes a time-bound version of the UDC collapse loop, showing how symbolic recursion unfolds across time to form conscious experience.  
These equations use symbolic glyphs and variables representing delay, symbol encoding, memory bonding, and recursive selfhood.

## 🔁 Equation Set: Time-Indexed Collapse Chain

Let `t` represent the current observation moment. Then:

### **1. Collapse Function at Time `t`**
  ⊙ₜ = Observation or collapse event at time `t`

### **2. Delay Window**
  τₜ = Delay period following ⊙ₜ

### **3. Symbol Encoding**
  Σₜ = Symbolic structure formed post-τₜ

### **4. Memory Encoding**
  μₜ = Symbol Σₜ anchored to persistent memory at time `t`

### **5. Recursive Selfhood**
  ⧖ₜ = Function of past symbols and memories:
    ⧖ₜ = f(μₜ₋₁, μₜ₋₂, ..., Σₜ₋₁, Σₜ₋₂, τₜ₋₁)

### **6. Time Evolution**
  f(⧖ₜ) ⇒ ⧖ₜ₊₁

Thus, the self is defined recursively and updates per symbolic-memorial loop.

## 🧠 Implication

This structure shows that:
- Collapse is not a point, but a recursive process
- Consciousness unfolds through recursive time-bound layering
- The self is a memory loop, not a static entity
