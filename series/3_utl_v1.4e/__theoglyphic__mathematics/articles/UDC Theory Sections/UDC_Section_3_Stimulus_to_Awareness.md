Understanding how consciousness emerges from delayed processing requires mapping the full path from physical input to felt experience. This flow reveals that awareness is a retrospective construction, integrating time, space, memory, and prediction. The following framework outlines how UDC describes this transformation:

### Stimulus Encounter
A physical stimulus (e.g., light, sound, touch) activates sensory receptors. The brain begins to receive input through dedicated pathways such as the optic nerve or auditory nerve.

### Transmission and Neural Delay
Signals travel through the nervous system and undergo synaptic processing, creating an average delay of 100–300 milliseconds before reaching conscious awareness.

### Predictive Processing and Memory Reference
The brain forecasts what the signal likely is using prior experiences and learned models. For example, the hippocampus and neocortex retrieve associative memories to narrow possibilities.

### Spatial and Temporal Anchoring
Regions like the parietal cortex and hippocampus encode where and when the stimulus is occurring. This process grounds the signal in a geospatial map and estimated time frame — both necessary for situating experience.

### Global Integration and Coherence
The signal, enriched by memory and prediction, is integrated across multiple brain networks (e.g., the Global Workspace or Default Mode Network). This stage is where disparate data becomes a unified moment.

### Self-Referential Modeling
The brain overlays the experience onto a model of self. “I see the bird” becomes meaningful only when the system recognizes itself as the perceiver. This requires recursive computation and identity anchoring.

### Conscious Realization
Awareness of the stimulus arises only after this integrative synthesis. This conscious moment is delayed, constructed, and informed — not directly received.

> This process supports UDC’s claim: consciousness is not about reacting to stimuli in real-time but constructing an integrated experience based on delayed, predictive modeling. The journey of experience is fundamentally computational, structural, and recursive.
