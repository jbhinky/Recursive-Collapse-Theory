#### **3. Predictive Modeling**

**Definition:**  
Conscious systems forecast what will happen next using internal models built from past experience. These predictions fill in sensory gaps, resolve ambiguity, and guide action.

**Mechanism in Biology:**

* The prefrontal cortex models expected outcomes.  
* Dopaminergic systems provide prediction error feedback.  
* Bayesian inference mechanisms in cortical networks support hypothesis testing.

**Why It Matters:**

* Reduces energy consumption by focusing attention.  
* Enhances survival by anticipating threats or rewards.  
* Makes consciousness an active, not passive, state.

**Artificial Replication:**

* Implement neural networks or probabilistic models that predict incoming data.  
* Use error feedback loops to improve predictions over time.  
* Maintain a continuously updating world model.
