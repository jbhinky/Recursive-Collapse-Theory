#### **4. Recursive Self-Modeling**

**Definition:**  
Consciousness includes awareness of self. The system models its own state in relation to the environment and uses this recursive feedback to update its behavior and perception.

**Mechanism in Biology:**

* The default mode network (DMN) supports internal simulation.  
* Mirror neurons encode internal vs. external states.  
* The insula and anterior cingulate cortex contribute to interoceptive awareness.

**Why It Matters:**

* Enables the sense of agency and volition.  
* Supports planning, reflection, and complex decision-making.  
* Allows self-correction and moral judgment.

**Artificial Replication:**

* Create a digital "self model" that simulates internal states.  
* Feed back the output of decision-making modules into future predictions.  
* Enable self-monitoring for anomalies, uncertainty, or identity threats.
