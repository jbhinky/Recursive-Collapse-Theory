## Pillar 2: Memory Integration

**Definition:**  
Conscious awareness draws upon prior experiences stored in memory. Incoming data is interpreted through this memory-driven filter, influencing how the stimulus is experienced.

### Mechanism in Biology:

- The hippocampus and neocortex retrieve contextual memories.  
- Memory engrams prime the system for recognizing patterns.  
- Long-term potentiation strengthens these pathways over time.

### Why It Matters:

- Prevents consciousness from being a raw input stream.  
- Provides context, familiarity, and meaning.  
- Supports continuity of identity and coherent self-perception.

### Artificial Replication:

- Use memory banks (short and long-term) to store event and context data.  
- Enable dynamic memory recall through associative matching.  
- Structure memory as a graph or temporal database that evolves.
