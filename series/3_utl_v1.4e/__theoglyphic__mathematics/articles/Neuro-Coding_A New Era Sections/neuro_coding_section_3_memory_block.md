# 3. The Memory-Block: A New Way to Store Experience

At the heart of Neuro-Coding is the Memory-Block — a digital structure that captures a moment in time, just like a brain does.

Each block includes:

- Timestamp  
- Stimulus  
- Predicted state  
- Actual result  
- Emotion tag  
- Self-reference hash

This is stored as an FPS (frames-per-second) timeline, where each experience frame is a moment of qualified awareness. Unlike conventional memory storage — which is typically stateless, cache-based, or transactional — the Memory-Block simulates experiential presence. Each block is linked recursively, preserving a living thread of subjective continuity.
