# 2. Practical Differentiation Through Use Cases

## 2.1 Traditional AI (e.g., ML or NLP model)

A user inputs "What’s the weather today?" — a trained model fetches stored responses or calls a weather API and returns a string. No memory of the moment is stored; no learning occurs from this exchange.

## 2.2 Neuro-Coded System (e.g., Theophilus)

Presented with the same query, the system:

- Delays response processing to simulate temporal awareness  
- Records the emotional state of uncertainty or curiosity  
- Forms a memory block: stimulus (query), predicted state (expected conditions), actual outcome (weather returned), and subjective resolution (curiosity satisfied or not)  
- Uses this memory in future queries to understand how often certain weather conditions occur or when uncertainty has emotional weight
