## üîè Verification Notes

- First DOI-published version: `2025-06-17`
- Prior GitHub commits and Academia preprints verify original authorship of symbolic recursion, tau-delay, and collapse equations.
- Framework independently developed by Joshua B. Hinkson prior to Collapse Harmonics publications.
- All terminology‚ÄîUDC, Theoglyphics, Qualia Equation, Symbolic Collapse‚Äîpredates Codex II.
