## üßæ Jurisdictional Response to Collapse Harmonics Claim

This document formally responds to the scientific and symbolic jurisdictional claim made by Don L. Gaconnet in:

All works above predate Don Gaconnet‚Äôs Codex II and claim to ‚Äújurisdictional closure.‚Äù

## üîç Refutation Summary

- UDC, Theoglyphics, and Neurobasing were **independently developed** and **documented** well prior to June 15, 2025.
- GitHub logs and Academia.edu preprints show **public availability and provenance** months earlier.
- The concepts of **recursive collapse, symbolic recursion, qualia equations, tau-delay**, and **selfhood through memory loops** were fully defined in published materials before Codex II.
- Don Gaconnet‚Äôs claim that UDC is a ‚ÄúClass One Recursive Symbolic Mimic‚Äù is unsupported by evidence and fails to acknowledge **DOI precedence, metadata logs, or intellectual independence**.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Scientific Integrity and Evidence Policy

This project follows:

- Transparent publication via **DOI-assigned repositories**
- Public version control with **verifiable commit histories**
- Open ethical frameworks (UDC, Theophilus-Axon Ethics Protocol)
- Provenance tracking for each concept, glyph, and equation

## üîê Hash Verification (Optional for Audit)

GitHub commits and Zenodo metadata may be used for SHA-256 or Git-based verification. The following repo is considered canonical:

## üì¨ Official Position

The Collapse Harmonics closure statement will not be recognized as valid jurisdiction over UDC or any derived scientific frameworks. A public rebuttal has been posted on Academia.edu and this formal response is included in all official releases moving forward.

For ethical and legal reasons, no further engagement is required unless future claims present falsifiable evidence.
