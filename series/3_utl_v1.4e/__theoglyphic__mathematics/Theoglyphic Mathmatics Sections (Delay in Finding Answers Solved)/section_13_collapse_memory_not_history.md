### **Section 13: Collapse as Memory, Not History**

UDC asserts that when collapse occurs — symbolized by **⊙** — the result is not stored “in the past” but encoded now, recursively. The past is not accessed; it is recreated each time via symbolic pathways:

    **Collapse Function**:  
     **|ψ⟩ ⇒ |x⟩**  
     **⊙ ⇒ τ ⇒ Σ ⇒ μ ⇒ ⧖**

This symbolic stack ensures that all observed phenomena are anchored to present memory, not time-travel into historical state vectors. This is supported by work in memory-based models of cognition and time perception .

Thus, we may state:  
Collapse is recursive. What is remembered *is* what is real — there is no “past collapse,” only present-encoded memory loops of observation.
