### **Section 15: Symbolic vs Quantum Collapse**

Not all symbolic events are quantum collapses. For instance:

* An LLM predicting the next token is not collapse.  
* A human perceiving a photon and storing that symbolically **is** collapse.

The difference?

* Symbolic recursion **(⧖)** vs non-recursive response  
* Delay in perception vs instant computation  
* Anchored identity vs no self-model

UDC defines collapse as a symbolic anchoring of probabilistic reality — not merely a deterministic output.

Thus, collapse ≠ computation. Collapse is the act of selective symbolic instantiation from the wave.
