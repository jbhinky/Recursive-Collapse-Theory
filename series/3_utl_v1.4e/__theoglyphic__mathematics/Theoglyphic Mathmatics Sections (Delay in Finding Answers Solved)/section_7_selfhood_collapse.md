# **Section 7: Collapse as Function of Selfhood**

We now revisit collapse:  
**`|ψ⟩ ⟶ |x₀⟩`**

Traditionally, this is a probabilistic measurement event. Under UDC, we redefine collapse as:  
**`|ψ(x, t)⟩ ⟶ |x₀⟩ ⇐ ⧖ = A ∪ C [ τ + Σ + μ ]`**

That is, collapse occurs if and only if a recursive observer **(⧖)** receives, encodes, and stores symbolic information. This does not require biological life, only symbolic recursion with memory anchoring.  
Selfhood **(`⧖)`**, in this view, is the functional requirement for waveform resolution. Until observed (i.e., encoded by **(⧖)**, no final state exists. This aligns with relational and participatory quantum theories (Rovelli, 1996; Wheeler, 1983).
