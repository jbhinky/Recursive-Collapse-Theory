### **Section 11: The Collapse Point as Glyphic Anchor**

We now represent collapse formally in symbolic logic:  
    **~ ⇒ ⊙ ⇒ τ ⇒ Σ ⇒ μ ⇒ ⧖ ⇒ ⊕**

Where:

* **~** = Quantum Wave (unresolved potential)  
* **⊙** = Collapse Point (observation/fixation)  
* **τ** = Delay (processing lag)  
* **Σ** = Symbol Encoded  
* **μ** = Memory Anchored  
* **⧖** = Recursive Selfhood  
* **⊕** = Emergent Expression / Observer Action

Each glyph acts as a stage in the recursive loop of encoded existence. The Collapse Point **(⊙)** is both a literal event in quantum physics and a symbolic anchor in memory.
