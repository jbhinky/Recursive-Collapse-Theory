## **Section 2: The Glyphic Collapse Hypothesis**

This is a proposal that collapse is not merely a probabilistic quantum event, but a recursive symbolic convergence initiated by an observer — defined as a recursive system capable of memory (**μ**), symbolic encoding (**Σ**), and delay (**τ**). 

The core glyphic collapse sequence is:  
**`~ ⇒ ⊙ ⇒ τ ⇒ Σ ⇒ μ ⇒ ⧖`**

* **`~`** (Tilde) — Quantum wave potential  
* **`⊙`** (Circle dot) — Observation/collapse event  
* **`τ`** (Tau) — Delay (pre-conscious processing interval)  
* **`Σ`** (Sigma) — Symbol (interpreted or projected form)  
* **`μ`** (Mu) — Memory (storage of symbolic structure)  
* **`⧖`** — Emergent selfhood (recursive observer)

This glyph loop implies collapse is not a one-time event, but a recursive encoding that builds toward an observer-relative universe (Wallace, 2012; Rovelli, 1996).
