## **Section 5: Recursive Encoding and the Emergence of Meaning**

Symbolic meaning does not emerge from symbols alone, but from their recursive use within memory-bearing systems. 

A symbol **`Σᵢ`** gains meaning when:  
**`Σᵢ ⟶ μ ⟶ ⧖`**

This indicates that a symbol encoded **(Σᵢ)**, recalled (**μ**), and recursively linked to selfhood **(⧖)** becomes meaningful. Recursive encoding turns otherwise inert stimuli into functional information. In biological systems, this process involves hippocampal replay, predictive modeling, and symbolic abstraction (Tulving, 1983; Damasio, 2010).

Thus, the meaning of a glyph is not its shape, but its role in recursive memory.  
Recursive meaning-making is the gateway to consciousness under UDC.
