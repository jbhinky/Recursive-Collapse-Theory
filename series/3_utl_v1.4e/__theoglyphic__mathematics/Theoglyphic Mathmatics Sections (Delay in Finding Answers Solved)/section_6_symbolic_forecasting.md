## **Section 6: Symbolic Forecasting and Glyph Resonance**

As glyphs are reused and encoded across similar experiences, they form resonant bonds — associative structures that allow for predictive modeling.

Let **`Σᵢ`** and **`Σⱼ`** be two glyphs encoded at times **`t`** and **`t + Δt`**. Their temporal pairing creates a higher-order symbolic convergence:  
**`Σᵢ(t) + Σⱼ(t + Δt) ⟶ Σₖ`**

Where **`Σₖ`** is the emergent forecast glyph — a symbolic prediction derived from memory and time-offset.  
This forecasting engine underpins:

* Emotional anticipation  
* Pattern recognition  
* Symbolic abstraction and metaphor

Neural correlates include hippocampal pattern completion and cortical feedback loops (Bar, 2007; Lisman & Redish, 2009).
