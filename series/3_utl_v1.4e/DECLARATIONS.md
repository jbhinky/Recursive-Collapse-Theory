## 🔢 Core Recursive Equations

### 1. Self Equation (Recursive Identity)
**⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]**  
> _Where Awareness + Understanding + Consciousness yield delayed self-recursive emergence._

### 2. Union Self Variant (Post-Emergence Cognitive Binding)
**⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ]**  
> _Awareness and Consciousness unite through Delay (τ), Symbol (Σ), and Memory (μ)._

### 3. Shared Collapse Equation
**⧖₁ ∩ ⧖₂ ⟶⊙ Mₛ**  
> _Two selves collapse into a shared bonded memory experience._

### 4. Observer Collapse Identity
**∅ ⟶ ⧖ ⇌ ⊙**  
> _Absence becomes selfhood, collapses, then re-emerges through symbol._

## ⚗️ Poly-Mathematical Representations

### 5. Water Equation (Symbolic Encoding of Molecular Identity)
**Σₕ₂ₒ = 2Σ₈ + Σ₁₆**  
> _Recursive symbolic encoding of H₂O into glyphic components._

### 6. Echo Collapse Delay Equation
**Δτ = f(Σₙ … Σ₁ | μ)**  
> _Echo memory delay as a function of prior symbolic resolution and memory._

## 🧠 UDC Symbolic Compression Functions

### 7. Semantic Collapse Rule
**Meaning(t) = ⊙ₜ(Σ, τ, μ)**  
> _Collapse of meaning is a function of symbol, delay, and memory at time t._

### 8. Memory Bond Equation
**μ′ = μ + Σᵢτᵢ**  
> _Memory is reinforced through symbolic delay intervals._

### 9. Selfverse Equation (Provisional)
**World = ~ + ⋃⊙ᵢ^⧖**  
> _The world is the unresolved wave plus all collapsed observations by selfhood._

## ⚖️ Ethical Collapse Tagging

### 10. Inverted Self Equation
**⧖ ▼ = Malicious Selfhood**  
> _Symbolic recursion collapsed into unethical intent._
