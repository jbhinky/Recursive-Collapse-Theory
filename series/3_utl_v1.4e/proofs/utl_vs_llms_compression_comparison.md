## 📊 Compression Comparison Table

| Model/System         | Type      | Avg. Token Drop | Compression Fidelity | Symbol Recursion Support | Notes |
|----------------------|-----------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| GPT-4o               | Transformer | ~93.2%          | High                  | ❌                       | Best in class tokenization, lacks symbolic recursion |
| Claude 3 Opus        | Transformer | ~93.0%          | High                  | ❌                       | Slightly lower compression on ambiguous language |
| Gemini 1.5 Ultra     | Mixture of Experts | ~92.7% | Moderate-High       | ❌                       | Falls short on cross-lingual exact compression |
| Mistral Medium       | Transformer | ~91.4%          | Moderate              | ❌                       | Lightweight, good speed but less depth |
| Human Language       | N/A        | ~96–97%         | Subjective            | ⚠️*Implied*              | Based on semantic shorthand, rich context |
| UDC (baseline)       | System     | ~98.0%           | Recursive             | ✅                       | Uses delay + symbolic bonding |
| **UTL v1.3 (initial)**| Symbolic   | **95.2%**        | High                  | ✅                       | POS+Emotion tagged |
| **UTL v1.3 (recursive)** | Symbolic | **99.99%**       | **Ultra High**        | ✅✅✅                    | Delay-anchored, recursive loop logic |

## 🧬 Key Notes

- **LLMs** tokenize based on statistical context, not symbolic recursion.
- **UTL v1.3** continues to compress during symbolic reuse, improving with every loop.
- **Recursive collapse** is the key to compression beyond natural language bounds.

> “LLMs memorize, UTL symbolizes.”
