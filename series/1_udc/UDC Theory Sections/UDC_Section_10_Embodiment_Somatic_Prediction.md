### **Section 10: Embodiment and the Somatic Basis of Prediction**

While UDC emphasizes cognition and computation, it must also account for the role of the body in shaping perception and consciousness. The field of interoception—the brain's awareness of internal bodily states—demonstrates that bodily signals (heart rate, hunger, temperature) are not peripheral to consciousness but fundamental to how prediction models are formed.

The insula plays a central role in integrating interoceptive data, acting as a bridge between physiological states and affective prediction. This means emotions such as fear or joy are not merely felt but forecasted based on past bodily patterns, which the brain uses to anticipate future states. These predictive loops operate at a subconscious level until integrated into higher cognition and self-awareness.

Embodied cognition further suggests that sensorimotor systems shape thought, meaning cognition arises not only from brain activity but from brain–body interactions over time. Feedback from muscles, the vestibular system, and gut-brain signaling provide contextual anchoring for memory and prediction. For example, the sensation of tightness in the chest may inform the prediction of danger and trigger emotional awareness before conscious thought occurs.

This somatic grounding complements UDC by reinforcing that consciousness arises through recursive, delay-based integration not only of external data but also of internal states. The self-model is built not just from what we sense outside, but from what we feel inside—delayed, interpreted, and projected into awareness.
