### **Section 7: Disorders of Consciousness and Cognitive Impairment**

**Disorders and Cognitive Examples**

* **Alzheimer’s/Dementia** – Loss of memory reduces predictive capacity.  
* **PTSD** – Over-prediction of threat based on past experience.  
* **Addiction** – Disrupted reward prediction.  
* **Schizophrenia** – Hyperactive predictions create hallucinations.  
* **Dissociation** – Breakdown of global integration.

**Alzheimer’s/Dementia** – These neurodegenerative diseases impair memory and disrupt the brain’s ability to connect past events with current input. As UDC posits that memory is crucial for predictive integration, this explains the corresponding fragmentation in self-awareness and time perception in these patients.

**PTSD** – Individuals with PTSD often experience involuntary reactivation of traumatic memories, causing them to misinterpret safe environments as dangerous. This supports UDC’s model by demonstrating how maladaptive predictive modeling — when memory hijacks the present — distorts conscious experience.

**Addiction** – Chronic substance abuse disrupts the brain’s reward and decision-making systems, impairing future-oriented prediction. According to UDC, this breakdown in adaptive prediction alters awareness, causing the individual to prioritize immediate reward over long-term outcomes, thereby compromising conscious agency.

**Schizophrenia** – Schizophrenia often involves hallucinations and delusions, stemming from failures in reality-testing and prediction error correction. This condition supports UDC by highlighting what happens when the brain’s predictive models become unmoored from sensory evidence.

**Dissociation** – In dissociative disorders, individuals may feel detached from their body or surroundings. This represents a breakdown in the global integration of input and self-representation, affirming UDC’s position that unified consciousness requires stable, recursive self-modeling.
