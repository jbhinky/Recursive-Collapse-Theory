# Section 6: Biological and Cognitive Phenomena Supporting UDC

## Cognitive States and Broken States of Consciousness

- **Dreaming** – Predictive simulation without sensory input.  
- **Resting State** – DMN maintains internal models even at rest.  
- **Memory Consolidation** – Predictive rehearsal during sleep.  
- **Split-Brain Studies** – Show fragmentation of unified awareness.  
- **Spatial Anchoring** – Consciousness maintains a modeled present.  
- **Hallucinations** – Support consciousness as an internal predictive model.

### Dreaming
During REM sleep, the brain creates vivid simulations based on stored memory and prediction, even in the absence of real-time input. This supports the idea that conscious-like experience does not require external stimuli but can emerge from internal processes that align with UDC’s predictive, memory-integrated architecture.

### Resting State
Functional MRI studies show that even in a resting state, the brain activates networks (like the Default Mode Network) that simulate past experiences and future scenarios. This supports the claim that consciousness is not purely reactive but operates continuously through internal simulation.

### Memory Consolidation
Sleep studies reveal that the brain replays recent experiences during non-REM stages to solidify long-term memory. These offline predictive rehearsals show how memory integration and feedback operate independently of external input — a key feature of the UDC model.

### Split-Brain Studies
In patients with a severed corpus callosum, each hemisphere operates with limited communication, sometimes resulting in two distinct conscious experiences. This underscores how integration across neural systems is essential for unified consciousness, reinforcing UDC’s emphasis on coherent, system-wide processing.

### Spatial Anchoring
Consciousness is consistently experienced as being "in the present" and in a specific location, despite the input being delayed and processed asynchronously. The brain constructs this unified sense of time and space through predictive modeling, which explains how we can act fluidly in the world despite neural lag.

### Hallucinations
When internal predictions overpower sensory input, the brain may generate perceptions that feel real but do not correspond to external reality. Hallucinations exemplify how conscious experience can arise from endogenous prediction — further confirming UDC’s assertion that awareness is constructed, not passively received.
